# Kyngesreach Campaign – README

Welcome to the **Kyngesreach** project! This repository contains materials and references for a collaborative tabletop RPG campaign set in the mysterious and perilous **Kyngesreach Archipelago**. The setting blends high-seas adventure, survival challenges, and eldritch mysteries.

## 🌊 About the Campaign

The Kyngesreach Archipelago is a vast, uncharted expanse of islands beyond known trade routes. It features:
- Treacherous reefs, unpredictable currents, and shifting geography.
- A tense blend of realism with rare, memorable supernatural elements.
- Survival challenges including resource scarcity, mutiny threats, and moral dilemmas.
- Diverse factions: from the profit-driven **Merchant Consortium** to the enigmatic **Stormcallers' Cult** and the pirate-infested **Iron Tide**.
- Memorable characters: Captain Elias Godfrey, First Lieutenant Isabella Hargrave, and Nyxie the ship’s cat are just a few of the colourful NPCs you'll encounter.

The story revolves around the crew of the **UPS Sojourner**, a fast frigate commissioned to chart the archipelago, establish trade contacts, and survive whatever lurks in the unknown.
