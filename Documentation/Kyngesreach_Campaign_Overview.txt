1. Setting Overview:
The Kyngesreach Archipelago is a vast and largely unexplored chain of islands extending far beyond known trade routes. While predominantly temperate and tropical, anomalies in climate occur, with rumors of icy islands, volcanic landscapes, and magical weather phenomena. Navigation is challenging due to treacherous reefs, unpredictable currents, and the lack of accurate maps.

- **Civilization & Ports:** 
  - Few islands possess proper ports, making resupply points rare and valuable.
  - The mainland port city, where the expedition begins, is a bustling hub of commerce and corruption—the last stronghold of civilization before venturing into the unknown.
  - Outposts and waystations are scarce, and many islands are completely uncharted.

- **Navigation Challenges:** 
  - Legends speak of islands that appear and disappear with the tides.
  - Star navigation becomes unreliable deeper into the archipelago due to strange celestial distortions.
  - Lore and ancient maps are prized treasures, often leading to conflict over their possession.
