### Encounter 1 – Distress on the Horizon

**Summary:**

- A lookout aboard the *Sojourner* spots smoke on the horizon: two ships engaged in combat, one visibly damaged and aflame.

- Captain Godfrey observes through spyglass and orders the *Sojourner* to intercept:
  - Issues commands for battle: clear for action, marines to quarters, gunners to positions.
  - Godfrey declares the attack to be deliberate murder and orders the ship into position.
  - Elena Vexley (sniper) climbs to rigging; Pembroke postures while Sergeant Mallory organises the marines.

- **Naval Engagement Begins:**
  - *Sojourner* gains wind gauge via Calloway's successful Weather Sense roll.
  - Fires port battery at long range with round shot—4 of 12 guns hit, all penetrate, dealing 19 HIP damage to the brig.
  - Second round: Baeli casts *Trailing Wind*, aiding Godfrey and Morgan’s seamanship roll.
    - *Sojourner* wins wind gauge again, closes to standard range.
    - Fires starboard battery (6 hits): 58 HIP damage, 1 critical hit (Steering - to apply later).
  - Brig fires but misses repeatedly.

  - *Sojourner* closes to close range; fires port carronades (1 hit, 11 damage).
  - Brig wins wind gauge next round, pulls back to standard range, fires but fails to penetrate DR 30.
  - *Sojourner* maintains pressure with alternating batteries and carronades; multiple successful grapeshot volleys:
    - Gradually reduces brig’s crew to below 66%, imposing penalties.

- **Final Rounds and Boarding:**
  - Merchantman is burning; some crew swim toward *Sojourner*.
  - Brig strikes colours; both pirate and merchant crew jump into water, causing identification confusion.
  - Boarding party assembled: marines, Penelope, Biele, and some armed crew.
  - Onboarding the brig, pirates initially appear to surrender, then ambush:
    - Pirate captain opens fire, killing a crewman.
    - Skirmish breaks out; pirate captain is ejected overboard by Biele using a powerful *Air Jet* spell.
    - Her display visibly impresses the crew and marks a high point in her arc.

- **Scene ends** with brig secured and celebration of Biele’s magical success.

### Encounter 2 – "Wreckage and Rescue"

**Summary:**

- **Aftermath of battle**: Remaining pirates are subdued; survivors (pirate and merchant) are rescued from the sea indiscriminately due to confusion over identities.

- **Salvage operations**:
  - **Merchantman ("Morningstar")** is badly damaged and sinking.
  - Crew forms a human chain with rescued "merchantmen" (possibly some pirates) to salvage:
    - Trade textiles
    - Assorted herbs
    - **Barrels of saltfish** (adds 6 days' food supply, adjusted for increased crew count).

- **Brig** (pirate vessel) is structurally compromised but searched:
  - Lower decks reveal **emaciated press-ganged prisoners** performing menial tasks.
  - **A young girl (~13), named Adwen**, is found in a makeshift cell with rope burns and trauma.
    - Possessions: dried herbs, alchemical supplies, mortar & pestle, and a small leather pouch.
    - Sojourner crew rescues her as the brig begins to founder.

- **Adwen's recovery**:
  - Biele gently befriends her with food and care.
  - Adwen is withdrawn but responds slowly; reveals her name and that she’s from **Tathryn's Cove**.
  - No info on her parents’ status; she’s physically stable but emotionally traumatised.
  - Godfrey and the crew support continued gentle care.

- **Merchant survivors interviewed**:
  - Ship was *Morningstar*, captain **Bren Calvin** (deceased).
  - Departed **Forenza three months ago**, but crew believe it's only been **10 days**.
  - Name matches one of the lost ships on Godfrey's list.

- **Pirate crew interrogations**:
  - Pirates refer to their group as the **Iron Tide**, operating as a "cooperative" in the Kyngesreach.
  - Ships often cobbled together or captured.
  - Led by a **Captain's Council**; most prisoners claim they were press-ganged.
  - Interrogation reveals:
    - **2 hardcore pirates**
    - **2 possibly innocent**
    - **6 undetermined**
  - Morgan warns the "undetermined" group they'll be revisited later; seeks to offload hostile prisoners.

- **Future course**:
  - Godfrey advises not to revisit prior island; risk of it being gone.
  - Sojourner continues sailing to locate new landfall.

### Encounter 3 – Fire Below Deck

**Summary:**

  - **Crew quarters search** reveals a **ditty bag** with matching charred rope, tar scraps, and bone-handled knife.
  - Unique **pipe tobacco scent** found in the bag—used to set **Ohaku** (Morgan’s dog) tracking.

- **Saboteur Trail**:
  - Ohaku leads them to a **hidden compartment** in the ship’s lower levels.
  - Inside: a **Kraken-carved box** with same tobacco, tools consistent with sabotage.

    - Tampered rigging and stolen fuse components.
    - Kraken-marked stash and attempt to frame Torrin.
  - Morgan argues it's a **conspiracy**, likely involving **multiple saboteurs**, possibly among new crew.
  - Godfrey requests a persuasive roll:

    - Agrees this is a developing threat; crew likely being primed for further sabotage, not full mutiny—yet.

- **Preventive Action**:
  - Suspecting the **weapons locker** might be targeted next, they decide to pre-emptively relocate weapons covertly.

  - Their break-in is met with a trombone alarm, and Morgan steps out with a pistol.
  - Loyalists emerge from hiding with arms already drawn — mutineers are **ambushed**.

- **Torrin’s Turning Point**:
  - Torrin emerges during the clash, declares allegiance to the *Sojourner*, and attacks a mutineer.
  - His dramatic declaration — *"To hell with your schemes, I stand with my ship!"* — confirms loyalty.
  - GM confirms this outcome was conditional on Morgan’s earlier social handling and rolls.

- **Combat Outcome**:
  - Mutineers are outnumbered, outgunned, and overwhelmed.
  - Godfrey halts the fighting with a stern call for surrender; remaining mutineers drop weapons.

- **Adwen’s Ongoing Integration**:
  - Biele continues caring for **Adwen** (“Winnie”), softening her trauma with stories and kindness.
  - GM reveals backstory:
    - Adwen is ~13, from **Tathryn’s Cove**.
    - Kidnapped by **Iron Tide** and forced to make healing salves.
    - Apprentice to healer **Eris Marthen**; her pouch contains seeds/herbs from home.
    - She has some **herbalism/alchemy ability**, enough to replicate minor trait effects like *Fast Healing*.
    - Physically malnourished; Biele monitors her development and health.

- **Crew Status Reset**:
  - Casualties suffered in both **boarding action** and **mutiny**, but offset by gains from **Morningstar survivors**.
  - Final crew numbers stabilised for the *Sojourner*.
  - **Excess prisoners** now a resource and a burden; the party elects to feed and hold them humanely.

**Notes:**
- Torrin fully transitions to **loyal crew status** following mutiny.

### Encounter 5 – The Flag of Truce

**Summary:**

- **Initial Contact**:
  - Days after the failed mutiny, a lookout spots a ship on the **starboard quarter** — another **Iron Tide vessel**, heavily armed and matching the Sojourner in size.
  - She flies **a white flag of truce alongside the Iron Tide kraken colours**.
  - The officer aboard is **First Mate Rannoch of the Sable Reaver**.

- **Rannoch’s Offer**:
  - Comes aboard under truce; presents the **Iron Tide** as a "brotherhood" of free captains.
  - Proposes **return of captured men** in exchange for **safe departure**, *no strings attached (for now)*.
  - Offers no coercion to join, but implies consequences for those who defy or reject the Iron Tide long-term.

- **Council Deliberation**:
  - Morgan argues against battle:
    - Too risky.
    - Ship is damaged and isolated.
    - Even if victorious, they could not survive the next engagement.
  - Calloway concurs:
    - Sees benefit in reducing mouths to feed.
    - Emphasises awareness and caution going forward.
  - Biele distrusts them, referencing the mutiny and their conduct.
  - Calloway uses **Detect Lies** — Rannoch **appears to be telling the truth**.

- **Explanation and Resolution**:
  - Stef explains stakes to Trish:
    - Accepting the deal buys time and presents the *only chance* to avoid immediate conflict.
    - Rejecting it guarantees a fight and likely reprisal.

- **Prisoner Transfer**:
  - Prisoners, bound and bitter, are transferred under heavy watch.
  - The Iron Tide sailors maintain silence and discipline.
  - Rannoch departs with a warning cloaked in camaraderie:  
    - “We sail as friends—for now. Think on that.”
    - Offers a **port location to the northwest**.
    - But adds a cryptic note: **“This cycle's nearly done”**, implying knowledge of Kyngesreach's metaphysical tides.

- **Aftermath**:
  - The **Sable Reaver withdraws**, leaving the Sojourner bloodied but unchallenged.
  - Crew is left with relief, unease, and a **new destination**.
  - Morgan to Godfrey: “Mark my words, we're going to need their knowledge yet.”

**Note:**
- “Cycle” flagged as a **mystical/metaphysical term** tied to Kyngesreach lore.
