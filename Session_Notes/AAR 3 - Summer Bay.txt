## Encounter 2 – Wreckage & Initial Exploration

**Summary:**

- Players awake to find the *Sojourner* anchored offshore from a dense jungle island.
- Morning conditions: humid, still sea, grey overcast sky.
- Breakfast scene:
  - Crew eats poor-quality porridge; Biele eagerly claims any extra portions.
  - Penelope offers her share to Biele and jokes about surviving on pickles.
- Crew prepares for landing:
  - Players equip for shore party (armour, pistols, crossbows, parasol with hidden sword cane).
  - Marines under Captain Pembroke and Sergeant Mallory accompany them.

- Landing scene:
  - Players row ashore with seamen and marines securing the boat.
  - Description of island: towering jungle, twisted roots, vibrant unseen flowers, oppressive humidity.
  - Players experience "sea legs" disorientation when stepping on land.

- Players approach and investigate a prominent shipwreck:
  - Detailed description: blackened timbers, twisted ribs, sea vines, strangler roots, rusted iron fittings, decayed sail fragments.
  - Morgan rolls Seamanship (success); Calloway rolls Carpentry (success).
  - Players deduce paradox:
    - Wreck appears centuries old in condition, yet matches modern construction techniques.
    - Godfrey comments: *“Built in the modern fashion but looks like the bones of a ghost ship. The Reach doesn’t rot you in years. It rots you in minutes.”*
    - Iron Meg quips: *“I’ve seen barnacles better kept than this.”*
- Nyxie hisses toward the jungle line but no immediate threat appears.
- No salvageable documents, logs, or metal found; wreck too degraded.

- Session closes with the group preparing to explore inland.

**END of Encounter 2 Summary**
## Encounter 3 – Signs of Being Watched

**Summary:**

- Players decide to explore inland; Captain Godfrey stays behind to secure beachhead and landing area.
- The jungle is vividly described:
  - Dense, tangled undergrowth, thick vines, oppressive heat, and damp soil.
  - Shadows and strange animal noises create an unsettling atmosphere.
  - Players experience the sense that the jungle seems to resist their passage.

- Biele’s danger sense activates:
  - Feels the group is being watched, curious but not yet hostile.
  - She stays alert but does not share the feeling immediately.

- Players discover a disturbing jungle idol (fetish):
  - Constructed from knotted vines, bleached bones, seashells, driftwood, and braided human hair.
  - Word "JAGULAR" roughly carved into the wood, partly obscured by mud and moss.
  - Idol sways subtly despite dead air; the jungle around it feels ominously still.

- Player reactions:
  - Penelope becomes visibly unsettled (yellow alert), grips parasol and pistol.
  - Calloway speculates “Jagular” could be a warning (players joke about portmanteau of jaguar and jugular).
  - No player has Linguistics, Anthropology, or Occultism to interpret the meaning definitively.
  - Calloway sketches the idol:
    - Drawing roll succeeds (3 under skill).
    - Produces a rough but functional field sketch for later study.

- Players move on, remaining on edge and unsettled by the encounter.
- Session ends with the heat intensifying and the players pushing deeper into the jungle.

**END of Encounter 3 Summary**

  - Morgan rolls an 8 under 13 on Cooking: successful roast of first pig, better than Cookie’s usual meals.
  - Nixie patrols and chases away crabs; receives reward scraps.
  - Penelope climbs palm tree (critical climbing success), collects coconuts, playfully searches for distant signs with spyglass (no useful discoveries).
  - Players consider coconuts and meat as valuable anti-scurvy supplies.

- Camp for the night:
  - Players and crew remain ashore at the beach camp to continue smoking and hunting efforts.
  - Notable morale boost from edible food; Morgan visibly more cheerful.

  - Destroyed smoking frame; meat scattered, burned, or stolen.
  - Ash, soot, and the smell of ruined meat hang heavy in the air.
  - Under a toppled barrel, players find a scorched wooden plate marked **JAGULAR** (note: whisper mis-transcribed as Dracula but context confirms JAGULAR).

  - Jagular has escaped but confirmed seriously wounded.

**END of Encounter 6 Summary**
## Encounter 7 & 8 – Discovery of the Village and Recovery of the Summer Bay Log

**Summary:**

- Players continue tracking the Jagular but instead encounter signs of civilisation:
  - Trail narrows, vegetation shows signs of human shaping, carvings of spirals and star symbols on trees.
  - Players reach a jungle village of primitive huts raised on stilts, with sailcloth patches and coastal influences.

- First contact:
  - Villagers watch cautiously; warriors appear with simple weapons.
  - Spokesman Moran invites players to meet the “Kaptar” under condition of peace.
  - Players agree, discuss internally to ensure the encounter remains diplomatic and peaceful.
  - Penelope gifts perfume to the Kaptar as goodwill.

- Meeting the Kaptar and tribe leaders:
  - Kaptar (chief) holds staff topped with old rusted sextant.
  - Elder woman (Surgon) bears bone charms and vials; young man with notched cutlass assumed to be Kaptar’s son.
  - Language is recognisable as heavily degraded English/Marine slang (e.g. “Moran” = Marine, “Kaptar” = Captain).

- Players realise the villagers are likely descendants of the lost crew of the *Summer Bay*, mixed with indigenous culture.
- Reference to the Jagular again causes visible fear and silence among villagers; Surgon calls it "not animal, not ghost, forest's anger."
  
- Villagers request players bring their "Kaptar" (Godfrey) to speak further.

- Players return safely to beach camp:
  - Penelope notes her gift deduction (19/20 perfume remaining).
  - Inform Godfrey of encounter and cultural findings.
  - Party debates setting a trap for the Jagular but ultimately decide against risking Marines or crew.

- Next day return to village with Godfrey and Iron Meg:
  - Welcomed with ship’s bell clearly marked **Summer Bay, Varenza Dock Yards** (confirmed by party’s Perception checks).
  - Confirmation of *Summer Bay* wreck and tribe’s lineage.
  - Players interact positively with villagers:
    - Calloway assists Surgon (medicine woman) and shares knowledge; learns she uses old surgical tools as mystical items.
    - Morgan repairs and sharpens Sarji’s rusted naval sword (8 under 14).
    - Biele critically succeeds on map analysis (3x1s); confirms map is a modern print from familiar mapmaker yet paradoxically aged.

- Players notice strange star confusion persists (navigational resistance, not celestial misalignment).

- Key prize recovered:
  - Surgon ceremonially presents Godfrey with a fragile, ancient logbook of the *Summer Bay*, described as "truth of water, truth of death."
  - Players agree to handle the book with extreme care; Godfrey retains it.

- Players prepare to return to camp to discuss findings:
  - Intentionally avoid saying “Jagular” in the village to prevent panic.
  - Banter about potential uses for Jagular hide (coats, gloves, purse, wallet).
  - Depart peacefully with prize secured.

**END of Encounter 7 & 8 Summary**
## Encounter 9 – The Logbook Mystery & Planning the Next Steps

**Summary:**

- The party returns to beach camp:
  - Tribe informs party of fresh water source; water stores fully replenished (Richard’s tracking updated).
  - Smoking pits packed down; no more pigs in local area.

- Evening at camp:
  - Biele attempts to play her penny whistle; first attempt fails comically (party jokes it may scare off the Jagular).
  - Penelope attempts to juggle unsuccessfully (defaults, mild success, crew entertained).
  - Crewman joins in with fiddle; second attempt with accompaniment allows Biele to perform well, lifts spirits.
  - Beach party atmosphere follows with music, roasted pig, and grog (Richard reminded to track grog use).

- Next morning: Godfrey calls private officers' meeting:
  - Attendees: Godfrey, Hargrave, Drake, Pembroke, party.
  - Sergeant Mallory intentionally not invited.

- The *Summer Bay* logbook is revealed to date only **1 year ago**, yet wreck and relics show centuries of age:
  - Godfrey confirms handwriting of Captain he personally knew.
  - Log recounts merchant ship *Summer Bay* fled pirates into King's Reach, encountered instant unnatural storm when attempting to leave, forced to beach on the island.
  - Crew survived initially off ship supplies, then tried to live off land (where log ends).

- Party theorises:
  - The villagers must be descendants of the *Summer Bay* crew, but time discrepancy is unexplained.
  - Godfrey confirms supernatural evidence (Enzo Falcieri incident, Jagular, island time effects).
  - Discussion of stars' distortion confirmed; navigation will rely on coastline and landmarks.

- Plans formed:
  - Sojourner cannot risk leaving without solving storm mystery; otherwise faces same fate as *Summer Bay*.
  - Biele’s cartography skills will be used to map coastline accurately (possible surveying if time allows).
  - Decision to consult villagers for known settlements and island size estimates before fully circumnavigating the island.
  - Expedition will seek additional islands of the archipelago after island survey.

- Final banter:
  - Iron Meg dryly comments “Next time we anchor, make sure it’s not on a ghost’s doorstep.”
  - Morgan replies: “I think that’s the only kind of doorstep there is around here.”
  - Nixie pads thoughtfully back to the ship, unusually quiet.
  
**Session ends. Next session will begin with returning to village for information gathering and island survey.**
