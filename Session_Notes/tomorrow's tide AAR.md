**📘 Scene 1 Summary – Quarterdeck Briefing & Decision to Revisit Village**

**🎙️ GM Setup:**
- GM reminds players they previously expressed interest in:
  - Re-visiting the village of the *Summer Bay* descendants.
  - Charting the coastline of the island they’re currently stranded on.
- Clarifies: while players can sail *around* the island, they cannot leave the **Kyngesreach Archipelago**, according to the *Summer Bay*’s logbook.

**🧭 Captain Godfrey’s Briefing (Delivered in-character):**
- Declares intent to chart the unknown island despite magical anomalies.
- Instructions:
  - Record everything visible; mark contradictions.
  - Hug the coast, log every inlet, question all terrain.
  - If the stars give three answers, write down all three.
  - Emphasises trust in Biele’s instincts as a navigator.
- Closes with:  
  _“We’re not lost. Not yet. And I don’t plan on learning how to be.”_

**🎭 Player Reactions:**
- **Penelope (Hannah):** Salutes Godfrey respectfully, visibly impressed.
- **Morgan (Michael):** Returns a sharp military salute.
- **Biele (Trish):** Notes blushing (unclear if joking or literal).
- **GM (Stef):** Reflects that this may be Godfrey’s best speech so far.

**🧠 Decision Point:**
- **Calloway (Rich):** Affirms value of circumnavigating the island.
- GM poses the choice to all: 
  - Revisit the village first?  
  - Or begin the coastal mapping directly?

**⏹ End of Scene 1**

**📘 Scene 2 Summary – Return to the Summer Bay Village**

**🎙️ GM Setup:**
- GM confirms players intend to revisit the village before beginning the coastal charting effort.

**🛶 Journey & Arrival:**
- The party travels through the jungle; familiar terrain, soft underfoot.
- Distant movement in the undergrowth is heard but not encountered.
- The village appears unchanged: raised huts, cookfire smoke, villagers watching quietly but not hostile.
- Players are recognised and welcomed without obstruction.

**🗣️ Key Interaction – Village Leadership:**
- **Kaptar (village chief):**  
  _“You return again. The sea has not taken you. Why do you seek us now?”_

- **Calloway (Rich):** Explains the intent to chart the coastline and asks if:
  - There are any places of interest they should know about.
  - Any villagers might want to accompany them.

- **Surgan (medicine woman):**  
  - Warns that “the land does not stay where it belongs.”
  - Mentions the **Saltwatch**, which once held the shores stable—now gone, though “the stones remain.”
  - Offers only generalised directions; locals know their area by instinct, not maps.

**🧭 Tribal Insight:**
- Villagers speak of:
  - **Unstable geography:** shifting coastlines, unreliable landmarks.
  - The **Saltwatch stones** on the far side of the island—implied to be dangerous or avoided.
  - No other known settlements or contact beyond their own tribe.
  - Subtle tension: unspoken concern that the large Sojourner crew might overhunt the area.

**🪵 Cultural Gesture:**
- The villagers present the players with a **driftwood token**:
  - Carved in the shape of a compass rose.
  - Symbolic “thank you” and polite parting gesture.
  - Interpreted jokingly by the players as a courteous but clear nudge to move along.

**🎭 Player Banter:**
- Players joke about the lack of a volcano or human sacrifice.
- Calloway comments: “Enlightening, but not very revealing.”
- Michael (Morgan) and Rich agree to resume the mission and return to the ship.

**🗺️ Outcome:**
- Players gain:
  - Confirmation of the Saltwatch as a site of interest.
  - A symbolic keepsake from the tribe.
  - No concrete geographical data—only warnings and vague cultural memories.

**⏹ End of Scene 2**
**📘 Scene 3 Summary – Surveying the Coastline: Shifting Shores**

**🛥️ Setting & Departure:**
- The party returns to the *Sojourner* and begins their coastal survey.
- The environment is immediately hostile to navigation:
  - The **compass spins unpredictably**.
  - The **jungle looms unnaturally close**, appearing to lean toward the sea.
  - The **anchor is left aboard** — even stopping would not guarantee a stable location.
  - **Seabirds circle nervously**, and the ocean itself seems uncooperative.

**🗺️ Assignment of Duties:**
- **Calloway (Rich):** Takes notes, watches for visual anomalies.
- **Biele (Trish):** Put in charge of mapping; Godfrey personally endorses her based on training from a renowned cartographer ("Old Sam").
- **Morgan (Michael):** Assists with seamanship; offers to support mapping efforts.
- **Penelope (Hannah):** Stands ready but lacks relevant skills — jokes about being present for "punching and murder."

**🎲 Skill Rolls:**
- **Biele succeeds at Cartography by 5.**
- **Penelope succeeds at Perception by 4.**
- **Biele succeeds at Weather Sense (or equivalent),** sensing that **some magical interference** is resisting her ability to map — an active, unnatural force.
- Despite supernatural interference, the party **does not become lost or double back**.

**🌀 Observed Anomalies:**
- A bay just charted appears moments later as a **sheer cliff**.
- The **island’s outer shape holds**, but **terrain details morph unexpectedly**.
- A large tree seen earlier becomes a **boulder** when the ship passes again.
- The **land resists being mapped**—geographic features appear and vanish as if the landscape itself is in flux.

**🎯 Experimentation:**
- Players suggest testing illusions by **firing a marked crossbow bolt**.
- **Private Eleanor Vexley**, a sharpshooting marine, is called in.
- Vexley fires at the altered cliff (previously a bay) — the **bolt ricochets off solid stone**.
- No visible magical backlash or alteration occurs, but the target’s changed nature is confirmed.

**💡 Theories & Discussion:**
- Players hypothesise:
  - The island’s terrain may change **optically**, not physically.
  - If the land itself shifted, the **villagers would notice** — but they don’t.
  - Changes may reset or vary depending on **viewing angle or time**.
  - The island is **actively hostile** to the act of charting.

**🔁 Reversal Maneuver:**
- Players decide to **reverse course** to compare landscape from the opposite direction.
- Godfrey orders the crew to come about — the ship **heels over** in a rough turn and begins sailing back against the wind.
- As they pass the same coast again, **another major feature has altered**.

**✍️ Resulting Data:**
- Sketches are updated to reflect conflicting terrain states:
  - Bay vs. Cliff
  - Tree vs. Boulder
- Charts are becoming a **record of paradox**, not just geography.

**⛵ Tactical Constraints:**
- The *Sojourner*’s draft prevents close coastal approach — **longboats are needed** for landfall.
- Musket or bolt tests are limited by visibility and range.

**⏹ End of Scene 3**
**📘 Scene 3a Summary – The Dead Calm & Magical Resistance**

**🌀 Event Trigger:**
- While attempting to reverse course along the shifting coast, **the wind dies instantly**.
- The *Sojourner* stalls in **unnatural stillness**:
  - Water goes **mirror-flat**.
  - **No sound**—no birds, no waves, not even rigging creaks.
  - **Ohaku whines**, **Nyxie hisses and flees**.
  - **Biele is overwhelmed** by a wave of wrongness, freezing mid-step.

**🛡️ Reactions:**
- **Penelope** drops into a fighting stance.
- **Morgan** checks on Ohaku, who is terrified and clinging to him.
- **Calloway** peers overboard for signs of danger.
- Crew members murmur nervously, several cross themselves.

**🔮 Biele Attempts Magic – Trailing Wind:**
- Biele casts **Trailing Wind** to break the calm.
- Immediately encounters **hostile magical resistance**—a force actively **pushing back**.
- Despite difficulty, she **forces the spell to succeed**:
  - The ship begins to move.
  - **Static arcs** crackle across rigging.
  - **Double fatigue cost** incurred (4 FP spent).

**⚠️ Shipboard Chaos Ensues:**
- A **rope snaps**, thrashing wildly – **Morgan** (Seamanship 10 under 14) secures it.
- A **lightning bolt** strikes the mainsail, starting a **small fire** – **Calloway** and **Morgan** coordinate a **bucket brigade** (Leadership 10 under 13).
- The **lightning’s afterimage** appears as a twisted, sigil-like shape—*not natural*.
- A **spar swings toward Biele** during casting – **Penelope** uses *Immovable Stance* (roll: 10 under 14) to hold it off.

**📉 Aftermath of the Spell:**
- Biele is visibly **trance-like**, unaware of surroundings.
- She pushes through until the ship is **free of the dead zone**.
- Fatigued, she **collapses to the deck**, gasping.
- Crew watch in **shock and awe**—some with respect, none with hostility.
- A crewman cautiously brings her **water**; she accepts, still shaken.

**🧠 Observations:**
- **Biele reports** to Godfrey:
  - A **force opposed her spell**.
  - It **did not retreat**—it simply **let her go**.
  - She **did not win**; the entity is **stronger**.
- **Crew murmurs** about “cursed waters” and “bad omens.”

**🧭 Discussion & Planning:**
- Players speculate:
  - The force may be trying to **steer** them in a specific direction.
  - It may only allow movement along certain paths.
- **Godfrey** thanks Biele for her actions, affirms value of having magical support.
- Plan to **continue charting** proceeds cautiously.

**💤 Biele Status:**
- Exhausted (down 4 FP), but insists she’ll **continue her duties**.

**⏹ End of Scene 3a**

**📘 Scene 4 Summary – The Smoke Signal & Mysterious Camp**

**🌫️ Opening Discovery:**
- The *Sojourner* sails in eerie calm — **no wind, no birds, no sound**.
- The crew spots a **thin column of grey smoke** rising from the jungle, **too clean to be natural**.
- A lookout confirms: *“Smoke off the port bow, just above the treeline!”*
- This is the **first sign of another human presence** on the island.

**🧭 Decision:**
- Party agrees to **go ashore** and investigate.
- Noted: The local tribe claimed **no other people live on the island**.
- **Mallory and two marines remain to guard the launch.**
- All PCs disembark to explore.

**🏝️ Shore Landing & Immediate Scene:**
- The longboat scrapes onto a **pebbled shore**.
- They discover the **wreckage of a small vessel**: splintered timbers, lashed hull fragments.
- An **orderly and professional campsite** lies just beyond the high tide line:
  - Neatly coiled ropes, banked firepit, stripped sailcloth lean-to.
  - Every detail suggests an experienced sailor — **no panic, no mess**.
  - A polished **copper whistle** hangs by the fire.

**🔍 Investigation:**
- Players search the camp using **Perception** and **Criminology**:
  - **Penny** determines this is not survivalist desperation — it’s professional seamanship.
  - **Fishing lines** are strung neatly.
  - **A battered wooden chest** is discovered in the lean-to, marked with initials: **L.H.**

**🧠 Identity Clue – Lucien Harrow:**
- **Penny** (via historical roll) realises:
  - L.H. likely stands for **Captain Sir Lucien Harrow**, famous explorer who **vanished 250 years ago**.
  - She recognises the name from novels and history — there’s a **statue of Harrow** in Varenza.
- Group concludes **time is distorted** on the island — consistent with the *Summer Bay* paradox.

**📯 The Whistle Decision:**
- Players debate whether to **blow the copper whistle**.
  - Penny jokingly warns against "tooting another man's whistle" — references poison, then relents.
  - **Calloway** accepts and gives it a **polished blast**, watching the jungle for a response.

**🧵 Loose Threads:**
- No immediate sign of the camp’s owner.
- Players suspect the whistle may draw the individual back.
- This event leads directly into the next encounter.

**⏹ End of Scene 4**
**📘 Scene 5 Summary – Meeting Captain Sir Lucien Harrow**

**🧍 Mysterious Arrival:**
- Following the whistle blast at the beach camp, a **figure appears at the jungle's edge**:
  - Tall, composed, dressed in **antique naval garb**.

  *“Sir Lucien Harrow, Royal Explorer. My vessel, *Hope’s Edge*, ran aground two days past. I await rescue from the *UPS Vigilant*.”*

- The group realises: **Lucien Harrow vanished 250 years ago**.
  - A known historical figure.
  - Statues and novels commemorate him in Varenza.

**🧭 Temporal Realisation:**
- The party explains:
  - The **Vigilant will not come**.
  - They are from the *Sojourner*—a modern vessel.
  - Time flows **abnormally within the Kyngesreach Archipelago**.
  - Penny produces a **modern coin** as evidence.
- Lucien lowers his weapon and accepts the truth with composed concern.

**🔫 Shared Technology Discussion:**
- Morgan hands Harrow one of his **modern flintlock pistols**.
- The group and GM discuss the **mechanics of matchlocks** vs flintlocks:
  - Functionally similar once ignited.
  - Matchlocks require a smouldering cord ("match") to fire.
  - Susceptible to **wind, moisture, and exposure**.
- Harrow is fascinated by the modern firearm design.

**🧠 Harrow’s Observations:**
- Notes strange **currents and celestial patterns** since arrival.
- Was planning to investigate **unnatural standing stones** further inland.
- Mentions being **stalked at night**:
  - Heavy footsteps, low growls.
  - Glimpse of **orange fur**—players suspect a **Jagular**.

**🐾 Jagular Foreshadowing:**
- As the group discusses, a **guttural growl** is heard from the jungle.
- Penelope playfully shakes her fist in its direction.

**📍 Decision:**
- Harrow agrees to accompany the group.
- The party prepares to investigate the **ritual stone site**.

**📅 Time Note:**
- It is **early afternoon** — enough daylight remains to reach the site and return if not delayed.

**🧭 Closing Line:**
> *“Fate has delivered me new companions. I will not waste the opportunity. Lead on.”* – Sir Lucien Harrow

**⏹ End of Scene 5**
**📘 Scene 6 Summary – Stalked in the Jungle**

**🌿 Setting:**
- The group, including Lucien Harrow, proceeds cautiously through the narrowing jungle.
- The path becomes choked and oppressive, sound dampened.

**🐾 Jagular Presence:**
- **Ohaku** freezes, ears flat, growling—**danger confirmed**.
- A **low growl** is heard—then another—suggesting **multiple Jagulars**.
- **No visible targets**—just movement at the edge of vision.
- The party feels **herded** or **studied**, not immediately threatened.

**🎲 Rolls & Tactics:**
- **Morgan** succeeds on a **Naturalist roll (11 under 12)**:
  - Deduces pack tactics, likely an **ambush setup**.
  - Expects a frontal strike with flankers—typical predator behaviour.
- **Morgan hands Harrow a spare pistol**, but Harrow declines:
  - Prefers his matchlock and isn't ready to adopt new tech mid-threat.
- **Morgan dry-fires an empty pistol** as a test.
  - Result: **no reaction**—movement continues but no engagement.

**💬 Tactical Discussion:**
- Players debate Jagular intelligence:
  - Are they smart enough to understand firearm cues?
  - Could they distinguish a dry fire from a real threat?
- Penny mocks the creatures, calling them **"gormless cowards"**.
- The team theorises the Jagulars might **understand intent**, or be choosing **not to attack** yet.

**🔫 Test Fire:**
- **Penelope** carefully fires a live round **into the air** as a further test.
  - No immediate retaliation—just **more rustling** and **displaced birds**.
  - Underbrush continues to shift, but no Jagulars emerge.

**⚠️ Mood & Tension:**
- The jungle remains **too quiet**—sound is absent except for movement in the brush.
- **No attack** follows. Instead, the sensation of being stalked slowly lifts.
- The party gets the **unnerving impression that they’ve been allowed to continue**.

**🧭 Conclusion:**
- Players **reload weapons** and decide to **press forward**.
- The **path clears**, but the **atmosphere remains ominous**.
- The encounter ends with **unrelieved tension**—no combat, no resolution, only silence.

**⏹ End of Scene 6**
**📘 Scene 7 Summary – The Saltwatch Circle**

**🌩️ Arrival at the Ritual Site:**
- The party crests a ridge and is immediately struck by a **violent gust of wind**.
- The environment becomes hostile:
  - **Dark clouds** obscure the sun.
  - **Thunder echoes** ominously.
  - The **sea crashes** below louder than natural — *as if listening*.
- The **ritual circle** stands exposed at the headland:
  - **Great standing stones** rise like jagged teeth.
  - **Carved spiral and wave motifs** glint faintly under bruised light.
  - There is **no shelter**, only the raw elements and an oppressive foreboding.

**🧠 Investigation & Observation:**
- No player has **Occultism**, **Thaumatology**, or equivalent.
- **Biele** quietly confirms:
  - The **same hostile presence** from the ship is here.
  - This place feels **deeply corrupted**.

**💬 Player Reactions:**
- **Morgan** voices concern about exposure on the cliff.
- **Penelope** recoils at the word *corrupted*, proposing a **retreat**.
- **Michael**, in character, urges **immediate withdrawal** before the worsening storm escalates.

**⏱️ Time Pressure:**
- The weather is **rapidly deteriorating**.
- The party decides to **leave the circle** and head back toward the *Sojourner*.

**⏹ End of Scene 7**

### 📜 Scene 8: Ambush of the Drowned + Jagular Rescue (Part 1)

**Setting:**  
The party is still at the Saltwatch Circle. A lightning strike hits the sea—then hulking, waterlogged undead figures ("The Drowned") appear from gullies and jungle. Six in total, armed with rusted weapons, close in under the howling storm.

---

### 🧟‍♂️ Enemy Forces
- **Six Drowned**: bloated, barnacle-crusted undead, jerky movement as if still underwater.
- They carry rusted cutlasses or attempt grapples.
- Immune to pain, slow but strong, heavily resistant to damage.

---

**Biele**
- Attempts multiple **Air Jet** attacks.
  - First two miss.
  - Third hits but does no damage due to DR.
- Air Jet damage is insufficient vs. Drowned, though knockback effect is triggered in principle.

- Initial strike bounces off DR (barnacle armour).
- Subsequent strike **wounds a Drowned**, then finishes one off.

---

---

⏭️ **Next:** Second half of Scene 8 continues as the Drowned press the attack—and the Jagulars make their move…
### 📜 Scene 8: Ambush of the Drowned + Jagular Rescue (Part 2)

**Setting:**  
The storm rages atop the Saltwatch cliffs. As the players struggle with the remaining wave of Drowned, **a second wave appears**—with **even more enemies** visible behind them. The party is running low on time, stamina, and options.

---

### 🧟‍♂️ Combat Continuation

- **Remaining enemies**: 3 original Drowned remain active.
- **Additional wave**: 6 more Drowned are visible and approaching, with hints of **even more behind them**.
- Party braces for continued melee.

- Remains a steady presence.

---

### 🐾 Jagular Intervention

- **Arrival:** Five **Jagulars** (island apex predators) emerge from storm and jungle.
- **First one crits** and **immediately kills a Drowned**.
- Their focus is **entirely on the undead**—no interest in the players.
- Combat continues briefly, but the outcome is clear.

- Dice rolled to determine player risk:
  - **Ohaku** takes **3 damage**.
  - **Penny** tanks another blow with her armour—no damage.
- The **Jagulars and party finish off the remaining Drowned**.
- Final wave is dispersed before reaching melee.

---

### 🌩️ Scene Closure

> “The last of the Drowned collapses with a shudder. The storm dies. Rain slackens. Sunlight breaks through the clouds. One Jagular pauses at the treeline, meets the party's gaze… and disappears silently into the jungle.”

---

- Major reveal: **Jagulars are not enemies** — they are predators of the Drowned.
- Emotional tone: Tension ➝ awe ➝ cautious relief.

⏭️ **Next:** Scene 9 — *Post-Combat Investigation & Harrow Recognition*
### 📜 Scene 9: Post-Combat Investigation & Harrow Recognition

**Setting:**  
The storm has passed. The Saltwatch Circle lies still. Steam rises from the soaked grass. The cliffs echo with distant surf. The party is weary, soaked, and surrounded by broken Drowned corpses. Bits of barnacled weapons, seaweed, and weathered rope litter the ground. The jungle remains silent.

---

### 🧠 Investigations & Observations

- **Morgan** begins scavenging rusted broadswords from the fallen Drowned — not to use, but to salvage as scrap metal for future repairs or tools.
- **Penelope** quietly retrieves her thrown shuriken.
- While checking the corpses, **Morgan (Perception success)** notices a familiar symbol tattooed into a Drowned’s arm.
  - It matches the same design previously seen on **Enzo and Matteo** in Varenza.
  - The group immediately recognises this as a **hard confirmation** of a link between the island undead and the cult activity back on the mainland.

---

### 🧪 Forensic Insight

- **Penelope** attempts to analyse the bodies using her **Criminology** skill.
  - Success is limited but confirms the corpses are **ancient**, heavily water-damaged, and clearly not recently dead.
  - Appearance: barnacles, seaweed, bloated flesh — “proper minging.”
  - Her verdict, delivered deadpan:  
    > “In my professional estimation: old corpses.”

---

### 🗿 Environmental Clues

- Players observe matching **wave and spiral symbols** on:
  - The Drowned’s tattoos  
  - The **standing stones** of the ritual circle

- **Biele**, after observing the aftermath and sensing the air:
  > “It appears that this fight ended the corruption.”  
  - Interpretation: the magic that animated or sustained the Drowned has been **broken** — at least for now.

---

### 🧓 Harrow's Recognition

- Harrow studies the stones and corpses in silence before speaking:
  > “I’ve seen magic. Any sailor with years at sea has.  
  > But this... this is something else.  
  > There were old tales, whispered by the oldest hands — of a group who withdrew into the Reach.  
  > Not feared — respected. Said to guide lost ships, still the storms, protect sailors who honoured the rites.  
  > I thought they were dockside myths.  
  > But these carvings — these marks on the dead — match the stories.  
  > It’s them. There can be no doubt.”

- Harrow insists the **symbols and motifs** match those described in ancient maritime folklore — a **benevolent order**, now clearly twisted.

---

### 🧩 Player Reactions & Theories

- **Morgan** proposes a wild theory: the **Jagulars might be the villagers**, transformed or related.
  - The party pushes back — sarcastic but intrigued.
  - Rich quips that if true, “they wouldn’t post signs saying ‘Jagulars’” to warn intruders.
  - **Penny** expresses hope the theory is false — she'd still like to own a Jagular (or wear one), which would be problematic if they're people.

- The group agrees on these confirmed connections:
  - The undead and the Varenza cult share **common tattoos**.  
  - The ritual site uses **identical carvings**.  
  - The **forces at work predate Harrow**, yet are still active.  
  - Something that was once **revered** has become **hostile** — or **corrupted**.

---

### 🗡️ Out-of-Character Realisation – The Hidden Weapon

- During banter, Penny (Hannah) reveals that her parasol contains a **very fine edged rapier** — a hidden weapon she purchased at great cost.
- Stats:  
  - 2d+3 cutting / 1d+4 impaling  
  - +2 to damage from craftsmanship, -2 to breakage chance
- The group realises, in hindsight, that if Penny had drawn her weapon earlier instead of relying on martial arts, she would have been **far more effective** against the Drowned.
- Laughter follows over the fact that her concealed high-quality sword was never used during the brutal melee.

---

### 🎭 Banter & Humour

- The party jokes about Penelope’s rapier having a **swan-shaped handle** that goes “honk” when parrying.
- Multiple riffs on *Monty Burns’ “See My Vest”* song, sparked by discussion of hypothetical Jagular coats.
- Penny: “I would ride you into battle.”  
- Harrow is repeatedly addressed with full formality as:  
  **Sir Lucien Harrow, Royal Explorer, Famous Explorer.**

---

### 🧾 Scene Summary

- **Confirmed link** between the island undead and the cult from Varenza.
- Harrow recognises symbols tied to **ancient sea legends** — protectors, now defiled.
- Biele notes a **magical disruption** — the corrupting power appears to have lifted.
- Players speculate on the Jagulars, the villagers, and the island’s secrets.
- The tone is tense but laced with humour. Answers have arrived, but **nothing is resolved**.

⏭️ **Next:** Scene 10 — *Return to the Sojourner & Adventure Wrap-up*
### 📜 Scene 10: Return to the *Sojourner* & Adventure Wrap-up

**Setting:**  
The party descends from the Saltwatch Circle. The cliffs fade behind them. Jungle heat returns. The air buzzes with insects. Mud squelches underfoot. No words are spoken — only the soft sound of the island reasserting itself.

---

### 🛶 Return to the Ship

- The party boards the longboats and returns to the *Sojourner*.
- As they climb aboard, **Captain Godfrey** sees Harrow and goes pale.
  > “Captain Sir Lucien Harrow. I know your name. It's in every lost ship registry going back two centuries.”
- Harrow responds simply:
  > “Gratefully accepted.”

- Godfrey shakes his hand and welcomes him aboard without further questions.

---

### 🧭 Debrief in the Captain’s Quarters

- The senior officers and Harrow gather below deck to share reports.
- The players recount:
  - The climb to the circle
  - The encounter with the Drowned
  - The arrival of Harrow
  - The inexplicable intervention of the Jagulars
- **Penny** delivers a delightfully noble summary of events.
- **Calloway** mutters, "We went to have a look, and this is what we found."

- Godfrey listens, then declares:
  > “I've no taste for ghosts or cults, but we came here for answers, and I don't intend to leave without them.  
  > Whatever curse this place held — *Lady Biele, your charts defied it*.  
  > That’s our way forward.  
  > We sail at first light.”

---

### 🌅 Closing Mood

> *The sun sets hard and fast over the jungle skyline.  
> Long shadows crawl across the water.  
> The night closes in once more.*

### 🧭 Naming the Island

With the immediate magical instability broken, players are told:
> “The island’s coastline no longer shifts. It can now be charted.”

- Suggested names:
  - **Harroway’s Rest** (Trish)
  - **Jagular’s Rescue** (Michael)
  - **Jaguar Island** (Hannah)
  - **Cat’s Rescue** and **Tom** also joked.

- Stef leaves naming open-ended for players to record in their own logs.
- The crew **never asked the villagers** what they call it — and now it’s too late.
