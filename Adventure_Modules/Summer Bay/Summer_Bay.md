# Adventure Module: The Lost Legacy of the Summer Bay

## Overview

This adventure begins as the **Sojourner** crosses into the **Kyngesreach**, triggering strange phenomena and setting the stage for the discovery of a long-lost ship and its descendants.

The goal is to reveal:

- The supernatural nature of the Kyngesreach and its **Tidal Lock**.
- That ships cannot easily leave the Reach once entered.
- That time and nature behave strangely within the archipelago.
- That a primitive island tribe are descendants of a ship lost only a year ago—but for them, it's been 300 years.

The adventure focuses on exploration, discovery, cultural interaction, and eventual revelation through investigation and diplomacy. Combat is possible but not required.

## Captain Godfrey’s Speech – Eve of Entering the Kyngesreach

**Setting:** *Quarterdeck, after the evening meal. The crew gathers under a grey sky touched with flame at the horizon. The wind is steady. The sea, quiet—for now.*

> **Godfrey (calm, grounded, the kind of voice that fills silence rather than fights it):**  
>
> “Right. Listen sharp.  
>
> Tomorrow morning, we cross into the **Kyngesreach**. The charts will still call it that, but for most sailors, it’s only ever been a name on the edge of the map. Stories wrapped in fog. Warnings passed around over grog. Most never get close.  
>
> We do.  
>
> We are not the first to pass this way. But we aim to be the first to do it on purpose, and with eyes open.  
>
> I won’t insult you by pretending it’s just another leg of the journey. It’s not. The Reach is a place where things stop making sense—and start making legends. The kind that end in songs, or in silence.  
>
> But we are not a drifting sloop chasing rumours. We are the *Sojourner*. And she is no myth. She’s fast, she’s solid, and she’s crewed by the sharpest, meanest, most bloody-minded lot I’ve had the pleasure of commanding.  
>
> We’ve got riggers who could thread a needle in a gale, marines who stand like iron, and enough sailors who know when to shut up and listen. That’s enough for me.  
>
> Tonight, check your kit. Square your locker. Say your prayers or swear your oaths, whichever gets you through the dark.  
>
> Tomorrow, we go where few ever return from.  
>
> And we do it with **backs straight and hands steady**.  
>
> *Dismissed.”*

## Crossing the Threshold

At first light, the Sojourner crosses into the Kyngesreach. The sea remains calm, but something *shifts*. Stars shimmer oddly. The moment passes quietly—except for Biele.

### Biele’s Episode

> Biele sways. Her eyes roll back. Her voice goes distant, hollow:  
>
> *"The sea holds its breath. Stars lie. No path leads back from here."*

She collapses briefly, shaken and confused. Other officers recognise this as a strong omen—though none yet understand its meaning.

## First Landfall: Jungle Island

Shortly after entering the Reach, the crew sights land. The nearest island is a **dense, humid jungle**, totally uncharted. Wreckage litters the beach—remains of a ship that looks ancient, broken, and half-consumed by the environment.

### The Wreck

- **Examination (Seamanship/Engineering):** The wreck appears **centuries old**, but its construction is modern—within the last 50 years.
- No markings identify the vessel.
- Fragments of ship structure and fittings can be recovered, but the wreck offers no immediate answers.
- Footprints are visible in the sand—barefoot, light, and recent.

---

## Jungle Exploration

### Environmental Features

- Dense undergrowth, towering trees, vibrant plants, oppressive heat and humidity.
- Navigation is difficult. Players may use Survival or similar skills to avoid fatigue or disorientation.
- The jungle feels *alive*. The players are being watched.

### Wildlife Encounters

1. **Insect Swarm** – Minor annoyance, morale or comfort impact.
2. **Quicksand Patch** – A hazard for inattentive players or NPCs (Torrin, etc.).
3. **Wild Pig/Monkey Encounter** – Optional hunting or chase scene.
4. **Jaguar Ambush**
   - Surprise attack on an isolated PC or NPC.
   - Evasive or non-lethal resolution possible.
   - Marks the jungle as dangerous and real.

### Signs of Surveillance

- Occasional glimpses of movement.
- Effigies or carved totems with nautical motifs.
- **Biele’s danger sense:**  
  > *"We're not alone. Eyes watching—curious, not yet hostile."*

---

## Discovery of the Tribe

### First Contact

- After initial encounters, the players are approached by tribal scouts—**Maran**, led by a **Sarji**.
- The tribe is cautious but not immediately hostile.
- Their dialect includes corrupted naval terms:
  - **Kaptar** – Chief (from "Captain")
  - **Fursmat** – Heir (from "First Mate")
  - **Surgan** – Healer (from "Surgeon")
  - **Sarji** – Warrior-leader (from "Sergeant")
  - **Maran** – Warriors (from "Marines")

### Tribe Presentation

- Players are brought to the tribal village.
- Prominent among relics is a **ship’s bell**, hung in the central clearing.
- Players may be offered food, drink, and a chance to speak to the **Kaptar** and **Surgan**.

---

## Cultural Exchange

### Social Opportunities

- Engage in ritual feasting or storytelling.
- Participate in games, challenges, or ceremonial gestures.
- Share knowledge, demonstrate goodwill, or offer useful gifts.

### Relics from the Summer Bay

Items revered by the tribe as symbols of authority and ancestry:

- Sextant
- Navigational tools
- Ceremonial blade (officer’s sword)
- Medical instruments
- The **Captain’s Logbook** – kept in the Surgan’s hut, treated as sacred.

These items are not immediately recognisable in origin, but careful inspection reveals:

- Ship’s bell engraved: **Summer Bay – Verenza Dockyards**
- Captain’s Log includes surviving passages.

---

## Identifying the Summer Bay

Once players see the name "Summer Bay", they may:

- Check their **ship loss manifest**.
- Ask **Godfrey**, who confirms:

> "Summer Bay? Merchant vessel, vanished out of Verenza. Just a year ago. No wreck found. We assumed her lost to the Reach."

This confirms that:

- The **wreck is the Summer Bay**.
- The **tribe are its descendants**.
- Over **300 years** have passed *for the tribe*—while only one year has passed outside.

---

## The Captain’s Log (Extract Examples)

> *"The stars are wrong. We corrected twice but the sea will not yield."*  
> *"Crew light-headed, restless. Spirits low."*  
> *"Storm came out of nowhere. No wind one minute, death the next."*  
> *"No chance of escape. I’ve run her aground. We survive or we vanish here."*

This confirms the existence of the **Tidal Lock**—the supernatural barrier that prevents ships from leaving the Kyngesreach.

---

## Outcomes

### Peaceful Resolution

If players negotiate successfully:

- The tribe may offer the logbook in trade for gifts, medical aid, or trust earned.
- The party leaves with knowledge and possibly minor relics.
- Future alliance possible.

### Hostile Resolution

If players push too hard or steal from the tribe:

- Tribal warriors resist fiercely.
- Players may need to escape under fire, pursued into the jungle.
- Future encounters with the tribe will be hostile.

---

## Return to the Sojourner

- Godfrey is briefed.
- The crew begins to understand: they are **truly isolated** in the Kyngesreach.
- Only way forward is **deeper into the archipelago**, seeking understanding and survival.

> **Godfrey (upon reading the log):**  
> *"So now we know. We're not the first to be trapped here... and we won’t be the last."*
