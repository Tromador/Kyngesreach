# Adventure Module: The Lost Legacy of the Summer Bay

## Overview

This adventure begins as the **Sojourner** crosses into the **Kyngesreach**, triggering strange phenomena and setting the stage for the discovery of a long-lost ship and its descendants.

The goal is to reveal:

- The supernatural nature of the Kyngesreach and its **Tidal Lock**.
- That ships cannot easily leave the Reach once entered.
- That time and nature behave strangely within the archipelago.
- That a primitive island tribe are descendants of a ship lost only a year ago—but for them, it's been 300 years.

The adventure focuses on exploration, discovery, cultural interaction, and eventual revelation through investigation and diplomacy. Combat is possible but not required.

## Captain Godfrey’s Speech – Eve of Entering the Kyngesreach

**Setting:** *Quarterdeck, after the evening meal. The crew gathers under a grey sky touched with flame at the horizon. The wind is steady. The sea, quiet—for now.*

> **Godfrey (calm, grounded, the kind of voice that fills silence rather than fights it):**  
>
> “Right. Listen sharp.  
>
> Tomorrow morning, we cross into the **Kyngesreach**. The charts will still call it that, but for most sailors, it’s only ever been a name on the edge of the map. Stories wrapped in fog. Warnings passed around over grog. Most never get close.  
>
> We do.  
>
> We are not the first to pass this way. But we aim to be the first to do it on purpose, and with eyes open.  
>
> I won’t insult you by pretending it’s just another leg of the journey. It’s not. The Reach is a place where things stop making sense—and start making legends. The kind that end in songs, or in silence.  
>
> But we are not a drifting sloop chasing rumours. We are the *Sojourner*. And she is no myth. She’s fast, she’s solid, and she’s crewed by the sharpest, meanest, most bloody-minded lot I’ve had the pleasure of commanding.  
>
> We’ve got riggers who could thread a needle in a gale, marines who stand like iron, and enough sailors who know when to shut up and listen. That’s enough for me.  
>
> Tonight, check your kit. Square your locker. Say your prayers or swear your oaths, whichever gets you through the dark.  
>
> Tomorrow, we go where few ever return from.  
>
> And we do it with **backs straight and hands steady**.  
>
> *Dismissed.”*

## Crossing the Threshold

At first light, the Sojourner crosses into the Kyngesreach. The sea remains calm, but something *shifts*. Stars shimmer oddly. The moment passes quietly—except for Biele.

### Biele’s Episode

> Biele sways. Her eyes roll back. Her voice goes distant, hollow:  
>
> *"The sea holds its breath. Stars lie. No path leads back from here."*

She collapses briefly, shaken and confused. Other officers recognise this as a strong omen—though none yet understand its meaning.

## First Landfall: Jungle Island

Shortly after entering the Reach, the crew sights land. The nearest island is a **dense, humid jungle**, totally uncharted. Wreckage litters the beach—remains of a ship that looks ancient, broken, and half-consumed by the environment.

### The Wreck

- **Examination (Seamanship/Engineering):** The wreck appears **centuries old**, but its construction is modern—within the last 50 years.
- No markings identify the vessel.
- Fragments of ship structure and fittings can be recovered, but the wreck offers no immediate answers.
- Footprints are visible in the sand—barefoot, light, and recent.

Players may infer time distortion has occurred, but **cannot yet identify the ship**. That will come later, during the tribe phase.

## Jungle Exploration – Full Detail (60–90 mins)

### Environmental Features

- Thick undergrowth, towering trees, vines hanging like curtains.
- Humid air clings to the skin; clothes become soaked within minutes.
- Jungle canopy filters daylight, creating shafts of gold-green gloom.
- Constant background noise: birds, insects, distant calls.

Players must navigate obstacles:
- Use **Survival**, **Navigation**, or **Athletics** to move efficiently.
- Cutting tools helpful; getting tangled or lost is possible.

### Jungle Event Sequence (Before Tribe Encounter)

#### 1. **Signs of Human Presence**
- Carved totems or bone-fetishes with abstract maritime shapes.
- A half-rotted sign or wooden shard marked with crude tribal symbols and one strange word: **“JAGULAR”**.

#### 2. **Wild Boar Encounter**
- One or more wild pigs burst from the brush.
- Combat or hunting opportunity.
- Pig may provide fresh meat (up to 100 man-meals).
- Opens up possibility for smoking meat.

#### 3. **Smoking Operation**
- Cookie sets up jungle-side smoking pit.
- Crew begins preserving meat using green wood frames.
- Jungle Survival or Cooking checks required.

#### 4. **Jagular Disruption (Non-Lethal Event)**
- That night or next day, something knocks over a smoking frame.
- A pig carcass goes missing.
- Deep claw marks on a tree. A smell of musk and ash.
- Nyxie hisses. Biele looks unsettled.
- The word “Jagular” comes up again—players may misinterpret it as a tribal rank or deity.

#### 5. **Jagular Observation**
- Hours later, they spot it: a huge jungle cat watching from a distance.
- It doesn’t attack. It waits. Then disappears silently.
- Biele: *“That wasn’t a cat. That was... something older.”*

#### Optional 6. **Jagular Second Strike (Combat)**
- If they track it or linger in the jungle too long, it ambushes.
- Drops from trees. Hits hard. Vanishes again.
- If wounded or outmatched, it escapes—leaving the jungle *changed*.

## The Jagular (Panthera botherensis)

A magically-influenced apex predator warped by the Kyngesreach’s influence.

**Key Traits:**
- Bad Temper, Ambush Predator, Catfall, Mild Temporal Dislocation
- “Oh Bother” Aura: Enemies must roll Will-2 or suffer a -1 penalty to defense for 1 round from sheer exasperation.
- Claws: 1d+3 cut. Bite: 2d+1 imp. Leaping from elevation grants +2 to hit, +1d damage.

**Behaviour:**
- Territorial, malicious, unpredictable.
- Steals food. Knocks things over. Haunts dreams.
- The tribe refuses to name it aloud.

**Tribal Interpretation:**
> *“Jagular not tribe. Not animal. Not ghost. Forest’s anger, maybe.”*

---

## Discovery of the Tribe (15–20 mins)

After surviving the jungle, the players reach a clearing:

- Large open area with **leaf-thatch huts**, **firepits**, and drying racks.
- **The Summer Bay’s bell** hangs from a wooden frame in the centre.
- Dozens of people—tan-skinned, tattooed with abstract wave and anchor motifs.

---

## Extended Cultural Exchange & Roleplay (45–60 mins)

### First Contact

- Intercepted by **Maran**, led by a **Sarji**.
- The tribe’s dialect contains corrupted naval terms.

| Tribal Word | Meaning | Origin |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Kaptar      | Chief   | Captain |
| Fursmat     | Heir    | First Mate |
| Surgan      | Healer  | Surgeon |
| Sarji       | Warrior-leader | Sergeant |
| Maran       | Warriors | Marines |

### Player Engagement

- Offer gifts (tools, rum, trinkets).
- Provide aid or trade.
- Participate in rituals or feasting.

---

## Relics of the Summer Bay

- **Sextant**, **Officer’s sword**, **Medical gear**, **Ship’s bell**
- **Captain’s Logbook** kept sacred by the **Surgan**

Log contains:

> *“Stars wrong. Tide against us. Turning back—storm rising.”*  
> *“No chance of escape. I’ve run her aground. We survive or we vanish here.”*

---

## Revelation

Players realise the tribe are **descendants of the Summer Bay**, lost only a year ago… but for the island, **300 years have passed**.

> **Godfrey:**  
> *"Summer Bay? She vanished not a year past. No sign. Not until now."*

---

## Return to the Sojourner

> **Godfrey:**  
> *"So now we know. We’re not just explorers. We’re prisoners. Same as they were."*
