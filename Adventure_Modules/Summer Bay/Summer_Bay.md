## Major Encounter 1: Eve of Entering the Kyngesreach

### Setting

**Time:** Evening, the night before landfall.  
**Weather:** Heavy, low clouds streak the sky with flame as the sun sinks. The wind is steady but carries an eerie hush. The sea is calm — unnaturally so.  
**Location:** Quarterdeck of the *Sojourner*.

### Narrative Flow

The call to evening mess has faded. Lanterns glow faintly along the ship’s railings. The crew gathers midships and on the quarterdeck at Captain Godfrey’s order — an unscheduled assembly after the evening meal.

The air feels heavy, expectant.

Captain Elias Godfrey stands near the quarterdeck rail, his posture composed, boots planted firmly. There is no theatrics, no booming address — only a steady, grounded voice that fills the air with quiet authority.

### Full Reconstruction of Godfrey's Speech

> **Captain Godfrey (calm, grounded, voice that fills the silence):**
> 
> "Right. Listen sharp."
> 
> "Tomorrow morning, we cross into the Kyngesreach. The charts will still call it that, but for most sailors, it’s only ever been a name on the edge of the map. Stories wrapped in fog. Warnings passed around over grog. Most never get close."
> 
> "We do."
> 
> "We are not the first to pass this way. But we aim to be the first to do it on purpose, and with eyes open."
> 
> (He lets the silence hang for a heartbeat — steady, serious.)
> 
> "I won’t insult you by pretending it’s just another leg of the journey. It’s not. The Reach is a place where things stop making sense — and start making legends. The kind that end in songs, or in silence."
> 
> "But we are not a drifting sloop chasing rumours. We are the *Sojourner*. And she is no myth. She’s fast, she’s solid, and she’s crewed by the sharpest, meanest, most bloody-minded lot I’ve had the pleasure of commanding."
> 
> (A few nods and murmured chuckles ripple through the crew.)
> 
> "We’ve got riggers who could thread a needle in a gale, marines who stand like iron, and enough sailors who know when to shut up and listen. That’s enough for me."
> 
> (A pause. He shifts his stance slightly, looking over the gathered faces — volunteers, pressed men, criminals turned sailors.)
> 
> "Tonight, check your kit. Square your locker. Say your prayers or swear your oaths, whichever gets you through the dark."
> 
> "Tomorrow, we go where few ever return from."
> 
> "And we do it with backs straight and hands steady."
> 
> (A final sweep of his gaze.)
> 
> "Dismissed."

The crew disperses slowly, the weight of the speech sinking in.

### Transition to Biele's Vision — Crossing the Tidal Lock

**Setting:** Later that night, midnight watch.  
**Location:** Main deck, under a grey, starless sky.  
**Weather:** The wind drops. The sea’s surface becomes unnaturally glassy.

The *Sojourner* sails forward into the emptiness — a boundary unseen but deeply felt.

As the players stand watch or rest uneasily, a sudden sharp tension prickles along the back of every neck. Nyxie hisses once and bolts belowdecks.

Then—

Biele, one of the expedition members, stumbles where she stands.

She clutches at the railing, her face slackening, her eyes rolling back to show only the whites. Her mouth opens — and a voice issues forth, hollow, echoing, not her own:

> **Biele (possessed voice):**
> 
> "The sea holds its breath."
> 
> "Stars lie."
> 
> "No path leads back from here."

The words hang in the air, chilling, wrong.

Biele collapses to her knees, gasping — and then regains herself with confusion and terror in her eyes.

> **GM Notes:**
> - The players are now, officially, trapped within the Kyngesreach Archipelago.
> - Biele has no memory of what she said.
> - Any player attempting Navigation (Sea) from this point suffers increasing penalties, though Biele's special navigation magic mitigates this.
> **Captain Godfrey** (after helping steady Biele):
> 
> (low, grim)
> 
> "We’ve crossed something. No turning back now."

---

## Major Encounter 2: Wreckage & Initial Exploration

### Setting

**Time:** Morning, post-crossing into the Kyngesreach.  
**Weather:** Hot, stifling humidity; grey, overcast light; the sea strangely still.  
**Location:** Landing beach of the unnamed jungle island.

### Narrative Flow

The *Sojourner* lies anchored offshore, her lines taut and her sails furled. The longboats slice through unnervingly calm water, carrying the players and a handful of sailors toward the misty green bulk of the island.

The beach is narrow, edged by snarled jungle growth — and there, half-swallowed by vines and sand, lies the shattered skeleton of a ship.

> *The sand clutches wetly at your boots. Salt tangs the air — but there's another scent underneath: old wood, rust, and something else... the sickly sweetness of deep rot.*

As the players land and secure the boats, their eyes are inevitably drawn to the wreck.

### Full Exploration Sequence

#### Immediate Impressions
- The wreck is ancient-looking: timbers collapsed into splinters, iron fittings reduced to flakes of rust.
- But the design — the sweep of the hull, the framing of the spars — is modern, recognisable to any trained sailor.

> **Skill Rolls:**
> - Seamanship, Carpentry, or Investigation (Per-based) checks.

#### Outcomes:

- **Success:**
  - Recognise this is not an old wreck.
  - Architecture is consistent with ships built within the last 50 years.
  - But the decay is extreme — centuries of rot in what should be a year’s damage.
- **Failure:**
  - Only perceive that it is "an old wreck."

#### Salvage and Discovery:
- Scavengeable items:
  - Rusted copper nails (minor value)
  - Shards of china and glassware
  - Corroded iron bolts and fittings
- No nameplate or clear ship's marks visible at this point.

### Key Character Reactions

**Captain Godfrey** (stepping lightly across the wreckage, examining a rusted fitting with a gloved hand):

> (low, almost to himself)  
> "Built in the modern fashion... but looks like the bones of a ghost ship. The Reach... it doesn't rot you in years. It rots you in minutes."

**Boatswain Margaret "Iron Meg" Kincaid** (surveying the wreckage with narrowed eyes):

> "Seen barnacles better kept than this."

**Nyxie** (the ship's cat):

- Pads around the wreckage warily.
- Stiffens and hisses once toward the jungle line.

**Environmental Details:**
- Heavy jungle scent: wet vegetation, rich loam, and something more acrid beneath.
- Distant, unfamiliar bird calls and insect hums.
- Vines crawl across the ship's ribcage as if the jungle itself is claiming it.

> **GM Notes:**
> - Encourage players to note the anomaly in age vs. design.
> - If they explicitly search for the ship's name now, they find nothing.
> - If they document the wreck, they gain valuable evidence later.
> - Subtle foreshadowing: Emphasize the unnatural speed of decay — not explainable by weather or tropical climate alone.

### Scene End Conditions
- Once the wreck has been thoroughly examined, the players naturally progress to preparing for inland exploration into the jungle.

---

## Major Encounter 3: Signs of Being Watched

### Setting

**Time:** Late morning, shortly after landing and examining the wreckage.  
**Weather:** Oppressive humidity rises with the heat; the air is thick, heavy, and buzzing with insect life.  
**Location:** Edge of the jungle, just inland from the beach.

### Narrative Flow

After leaving the wreck behind, the players press into the jungle.

The path is barely a path at all — just gaps between the massive roots of towering trees. Vines dangle from above like nooses. The air is a humid soup of rotting vegetation, wet earth, and the pungent smell of unseen blooms.

The light dims almost immediately under the thick canopy.

As they move further in, a persistent, crawling sense settles on them — a feeling of being watched.

### Biele's Danger Sense Activation

Without warning, Biele halts mid-stride.

Her face goes pale; her hand tightens involuntarily on her weapon belt.

> **Biele (low, urgent):**
> 
> "We're not alone. Eyes in the trees. Watching. Curious — not hostile... yet."

> **GM Notes:**
> - This is not an attack trigger yet.
> - Encourage player caution — perception checks may reveal glimpses of movement but no clear enemy.
> - Biele’s sensing is accurate — they are being observed, but not approached aggressively at this stage.

### Environmental and Sensory Detail

- Small things scuttle just out of sight beneath the undergrowth.
- Bird calls fall abruptly silent as they pass.
- A thick curtain of vines parts ahead, revealing—

A small, crude idol.

### Discovery: Jungle Idol

Hanging from a low branch is a rough fetish figure:

- Constructed of knotted vine, bone fragments, and jungle feathers.
- It sways slowly, though no breeze stirs.
- The base of the figure is carved with a single word:

  **"JAGULAR"**

The letters are rough, childlike, and half-obscured by mud and weathering.

> **GM Notes:**
> - Players may roll Linguistics, Anthropology, or Occultism to assess the idol.
> - Success suggests it is a warning, not an offering.
> - Failure suggests only that it is "strange tribal art."

### Player Dialogue Opportunities

- First reactions should be encouraged:
  - "Jagular? Maybe a tribal title?"
  - "Could be a shaman or warrior caste."
  - "Sounds like a juggler. Maybe they have festivals."

- Encourage speculation. Do not correct them. Let them misinterpret freely — it heightens later tension.

> **Environmental Cue:**
> - Somewhere deeper in the jungle, a branch snaps sharply.
> - No immediate threat reveals itself.

### GM-side Tension Building

> **Soft Signals to Players:**
> - Shadows flit in the periphery.
> - Twigs break under unseen feet.
> - Nyxie growls quietly, fur standing on end — but stays close to the players.

### Scene End Conditions

- After studying the idol and adjusting their course, the players continue inland.
- Subtle signs of watchers remain constant — footprints half-seen, the occasional flash of movement.
- Next event: Wild Boar Encounter.

---

## Major Encounter 4: Wild Boar Encounter and Smoking Operations

### Setting

**Time:** Late morning to early afternoon, shortly after discovering the jungle idol.  
**Weather:** Heat intensifies, humidity thickens; the air is alive with buzzing insects and the distant calls of unseen creatures.  
**Location:** Dense jungle interior, uneven ground with tangled roots and scattered muddy hollows.

### Narrative Flow

After passing the idol, the players push deeper into the jungle. The foliage becomes thicker, the footing worse.

Suddenly, a sharp rustling erupts from the undergrowth ahead.

A moment later, a wild boar — squat, muscular, and glistening with sweat and mud — bursts into view.

It lowers its tusked head and paws the ground, clearly agitated and territorial.

### Encounter Setup

> **GM Notes:**
> - The wild boar is aggressive but not suicidal. It defends its territory or piglets.
> - Players may avoid combat with clever tactics (Intimidation, Survival, Animal Handling rolls).
> - If provoked or mishandled, the boar charges immediately.

**Wild Boar Stats:**

- **ST 13** **DX 11** **IQ 3** **HT 13**
- **HP 13** **Will 10** **Per 12** **FP 13**
- **Speed 6** **Move 7**
- **SM 0** (about 3–4 feet long)
- **DR 2** (thick hide and fat)

**Traits:**

- Bad Temper (12), Berserk (15)
- Enhanced Move (Ground) 1
- Fur, Horizontal, Quadruped
- Extra Fat
- Acute Smell 2

**Skills:**

- Brawling 12
- Survival (Jungle) 11

**Attacks:**

- Tusks (slam or gore): 1d+2 impaling
- Slam/Trample: 2d-1 crushing (if charging at full Move)

**Tactics:**

- Charges and gores.
- May circle and retreat briefly, then charge again.
- If enraged (injured, blood scent), enters Berserk and fights to the death.

### Encounter Options

- **Fight**:
  - Standard combat sequence.
  - If the boar is killed cleanly, players may harvest it for meat.
- **Drive Off**:
  - Successful Animal Handling, Intimidation, or Tactical Movement could scare it off without bloodshed.
- **Trap or Ambush**:
  - Players with jungle survival skills might set up a quick snare or kill zone.

> **GM Tip:**  
> Successful rolls to calm or trap the boar should feel earned — the jungle is unforgiving.

### Post-Encounter Results

**If the Boar is Killed:**

- Estimated 60 kg of usable meat.
- Good for 90–100 man-meals.
- Immediate opportunity to start a smoking operation — if players think of it, or Cookie suggests it later.

**If the Boar Escapes or Is Driven Off:**

- The jungle remains dangerous — the players will stay on edge.
- Future hunts may be made harder as the local wildlife grows more wary.

---

## Smoking Operations: Practical Details

Following the butchering of the first boar, Cookie and a handful of crew immediately set about creating a rough smoking operation.

**Construction Details:**

- Frames built from green jungle wood — lashed together with salvaged rope and vines.
- Two shallow pits dug and filled with slow-burning embers from foraged wood.
- Frames strung above the fire to hold thin-sliced meat.
- Canvas salvaged from old sails stretched overhead to protect against rain.

> **GM Notes:**
> - Survival (Jungle) and Carpentry rolls can assist with frame construction.
> - Cooking or Housekeeping rolls help properly prepare meat for long smoking sessions.
> - If players assist or lead, chance of success improves significantly.

**Production Rate:**

- 1 adult pig yields ~60 kg of usable meat.
- Smoking rate: roughly 1 pig per 8–12 hours per pit.
- Crew can reasonably operate 2 pits simultaneously with available manpower.

> **GM Mechanics:**
> - 2 pigs smoked per day = ~120 kg preserved (under good conditions).
> - Enough for ~240 man-meals (with spoilage margins), lasting several days.

**Environmental Challenges:**

- Jungle humidity slows smoking and risks spoilage.
- Weather checks may require emergency tarp coverage (Survival roll).
- Predators (notably the Jagular) may be attracted by the smell.

---

## Marines' Boar-Hunting Expedition

Recognising the opportunity to build up preserved food reserves, Captain Godfrey authorises a hunting operation:

> **Captain Godfrey (dryly):**
> 
> "One pig’s a meal. I want a week’s worth. Take a squad. Bring back meat, not excuses."

> **Sergeant Bridget Mallory (gruffly, to her marines):**
> 
> "You heard the Captain. Track it. Kill it. Haul it. And don’t come back smelling like dinner."

### Hunting Operation Mechanics

**Squad Composition:**

- 6–8 marines led by an experienced sergeant.
- Optional: Players may join or supervise.

**Resolution Options:**

- **Abstracted Roll**:
  - Sergeant's Survival (Jungle) or Tracking check (primary).
  - Bonuses if players aid or give sound advice.
  - Penalties for weather, poor gear, or previous mistakes.

- **Result Table:**
  - **Critical Success**: Bag 3+ pigs and piglets, no injuries.
  - **Success**: 1–2 pigs secured, minor fatigue.
  - **Failure**: Prey spooked; no kills; minor injuries (scratches, falls).
  - **Critical Failure**: Ambush by larger animal (Jagular, or furious alpha boar).

- **If Players Want Full Encounter**:
  - Run full jungle combat scene:
    - Terrain: dense foliage, mud, low visibility.
    - Wild pigs: aggressive, territorial, fast-moving.
    - Hazards: quicksand patches, hornet nests, heavy rains.

### Resulting Meat Stockpiles

- Each adult boar caught = ~60 kg meat → 90–100 meals.
- Smoking continues in two pits, feeding into Sojourner’s stores.

If multiple pigs are caught:

- Create a small meat reserve — enough to survive 5–7 days without relying solely on ship’s hardtack.

---

## Additional Scene Flavour and Roleplay

**Cookie (rubbing his hands together gleefully):**

> "You get me three more of these, and I’ll stop cooking biscuits like bricks. Maybe."

**Boatswain Iron Meg (smirking at the marines hauling carcasses):**

> "Look at that. A day's work, and not one of you lost an arm. Almost makes me proud."

**First Lieutenant Hargrave (musing quietly):**

> (to players)
> 
> "Strange, isn't it? That we’re fighting the land for meat while the sea waits to devour us again."

**Nyxie**:

- Prowls near the meat pits.
- Chases away opportunistic crabs and scavengers.

---

## GM Notes on Further Complications

> **Possible complications to deploy if needed:**
> - Sudden jungle downpour — forcing emergency meat rescue (Survival + Speed-based tasks).
> - Predators attracted by meat smell — surprise animal encounter.
> - Tribal scouts observe the players — might see large hunting parties as a threat if misinterpreted.
> - Food spoilage if smoking pits are mismanaged.

---

## Scene End Conditions

- Players have fresh meat (and a morale opportunity).
- Opened possibility for a meat-smoking operation on the beach or in jungle clearings.
- Marines' hunting expeditions can continue if players order them.
- Encourages longer jungle operations — and attracts new predators’ attention...
- Next event: First Jagular Incident (Disruption at the Smoking Pit).


---

## Major Encounter 5: First Jagular Incident (Disruption at the Smoking Pit)

### Setting

**Time:** Afternoon, following the successful boar hunt.  
**Weather:** Thick clouds gathering; air dense and heavy, smells of wet leaves and charcoal smoke.  
**Location:** Jungle-edge clearing near the beach, where the crew has established makeshift smoking pits.

### Narrative Flow

After the wild boar is brought back, the crew gets to work.

A rough smoking pit is built:

- A frame of green wood lashed together.
- A slow, smoky fire burning under racks of butchered pork.

Crew sweat under the hot, oppressive air, half-listening to the buzz of insects and the occasional squawk of unseen birds. Cookie, red-faced and gleeful, is orchestrating the chaos like a battlefield general.

> **Cookie (shouting):**
> 
> "Keep the green wood above the flame, not on it, you goat-fingered swabs! You want smoke, not fire!"

There’s a sense of accomplishment in the air — fresh meat is a rare luxury.

### Disruption: The Jagular Strikes

Without warning, the atmosphere changes.

Nyxie’s fur fluffs. She stiffens, stares into the jungle — and hisses low and sharp.

A heartbeat later, from the shadows at the edge of the clearing:

- A blur of tawny movement.
- A crashing sound.
- One of the smoking frames collapses in a tangled heap of half-smoked meat and broken poles.

A guttural, almost growling noise follows — like something huge clearing its throat in irritation.

> *There is no clear sight of the creature — just the flash of something large and low to the ground, a dragging disturbance through the brush.*

In the confusion:

- One half-cured pig carcass vanishes into the undergrowth, dragged by unseen paws.
- Deep gouges are left in the smoking frame timbers — long, ragged claw marks.

### Immediate Player Choices

- **Pursue immediately** into the jungle (risky, dangerous).
- **Fortify the camp** and prepare for a potential second strike.
- **Investigate the wreckage** for clues about what attacked.
- **Try to track the thief later** (Survival (Jungle) rolls, penalties for delay).

> **GM Notes:**
> - Players should feel the presence of something real, dangerous, and aware.
> - This is not just a random beast — it chose to disrupt, not attack directly.

### Discovery: Dragging Marks

Examining the disturbed area reveals:

- Deep claw gouges in wood.
- Dragging tracks leading into the denser jungle.
- Scattered feathers and bones crushed underfoot.

Pinned under an overturned barrel:

- A half-charred wooden plate.
- Scratched into the surface, clearly visible:

  **"Jagular"**

Same word as on the earlier idol.

### Player Misinterpretation

Encourage player dialogue:

- "Maybe it's a title after all — like a sheriff?"
- "Some kind of tribal guardian?"
- "Maybe it’s their version of a pig thief?"

Let them draw wrong conclusions. Maintain mystery.

### Character Reactions

**Cookie (furious, throwing a ladle down):**

> "That was good meat! I'll skin whatever thieving sod took it, I swear it on my last biscuit!"

**Sergeant Bridget Mallory (coolly assessing the damage):**

> (to players, dryly)
> 
> "You lot wanted fresh meat. Seems something else did too. Next time, guard the damned pigs."

**Nyxie:**

- Stays near the players, tail puffed, low growling.

### GM-side Tension

> **Soft Signals:**
> - The jungle seems quieter now, except for the creaking of the damaged smoking frame.
> - A faint rustling — far away, circling, unseen.

The Jagular has made its first move — disruptive, chaotic, and unseen.

It may not be finished.

### Scene End Conditions

- Players may elect to fortify the camp.
- Tracking rolls may follow to pursue the thief.
- The players — and the crew — are now properly rattled.
- Next event: Second Jagular Appearance (Optional Ambush or Chase).

---

## Major Encounter 6: Second Jagular Appearance (Optional Ambush or Chase)

### Setting

**Time:** Early evening, after the disruption at the smoking pit.  
**Weather:** Overcast, air thick and close; oppressive heat still radiates from the ground, but the light is beginning to fade.  
**Location:** Jungle-edge clearing and surrounding dense foliage.

### Narrative Flow

The players and crew work to rebuild the smoking frames or secure the camp. Tension crackles through the air — the sense of being watched has not faded. If anything, it has grown stronger.

Nyxie remains coiled tightly near the players, refusing to stray.

Some of the sailors mutter nervously, casting glances into the thickening shadows.

The jungle, which should be full of insect and bird calls, is disturbingly silent.

### Trigger Event: The Jagular Returns

If the players have taken no special precautions:

- A sudden rustle from above.
- A sharp crack of a branch giving way.
- A blur of motion — and a massive shape drops from the trees.

**Target**:
- Random PC or vulnerable crewmember.
- The Jagular attempts a hit-and-run assault, not a full committed fight.

If the players have fortified or are alert:

- They hear the creak of a branch beforehand.
- A chance to react (Perception rolls) — gaining a defensive bonus.

### The Jagular: Attack Mechanics

> **Jagular Quick Stats (Summary):**
> - **ST 18** **DX 13** **IQ 4** **HT 15**
> - **HP 20** **Move 10**
> - **Claws:** 1d+3 cutting
> - **Bite:** 2d+1 impaling
> - **Drop Attack:** +2 to hit, +1d damage if dropping from height
> - **Special:** "Oh Bother" Aura — Will-2 check or suffer -1 active defense for first round.

> **GM Notes:**
> - It ambushes with suddenness and uncanny accuracy.
> - If it takes serious injury, it retreats immediately.
> - If successful in causing panic or minor injury, it vanishes back into the jungle.

### Combat Options

- **Immediate Counterattack**:
  - Players may attack back if they survive the ambush.
  - Tracking the Jagular afterward is possible but very hard (Survival -3).
- **Pursuit**:
  - If the players chase immediately, the jungle slows movement.
  - Footing penalties apply.
  - A secondary ambush is possible if they are reckless.
- **Fortification**:
  - Players may try to hold the camp perimeter.
  - Setting traps or alarms around the camp would deter future strikes.

### Environmental Details

- The jungle grows dark fast under the canopy.
- Mist begins to creep from the undergrowth.
- Every creak and branch snap sets nerves on edge.

### Character Reactions

**Captain Godfrey (grim, after the strike):**

> (clipped tone)
> 
> "It’s not just hunger. It’s testing us. Watching. Choose your next steps carefully."

**First Lieutenant Isabella Hargrave (quiet, concerned):**

> (to players)
> 
> "It’s intelligent. Maybe even worse — it’s angry."

**Nyxie:**

- Hides under a crate after the attack.
- Growls low whenever anyone approaches the jungle edge.

**Crew (general mood):**

- On edge.
- Whispers of omens, curses, and 'angry spirits'.

### Player Misinterpretation Reinforced

- "The Jagular must be a title for their warrior-guardian!"
- "They’ve set their champion on us!"
- "Maybe we’ve trespassed without knowing."

Let them continue misunderstanding — it deepens the punch when they realise later that the Jagular isn't part of the tribe at all.

### GM-side Tension Tools

> **Soft Signals:**
> - Occasional flashes of gold-and-black fur glimpsed through the underbrush.
> - Heavy scratches gouged into trees at shoulder height.
> - Muffled "huff" sounds from deep in the jungle, almost like a frustrated growl.

### Scene End Conditions

- Players either:
  - Fortify and prepare for further threats.
  - Hunt the Jagular proactively (dangerous).
  - Focus on moving inland to find civilization or answers.
- **Next event**: Arrival at the Village (Tribal First Contact).

---

## Major Encounter 7: Arrival at the Village (Tribal First Contact)

### Setting

**Time:** Early nightfall; sky a deep bruised purple, the jungle alive with the rising sounds of nocturnal creatures.  
**Weather:** Heavy mist rising from the jungle floor, clinging to tree trunks and undergrowth.  
**Location:** Edge of the tribal village clearing.

### Narrative Flow

After the second Jagular incident, the players push inland, weary and tense.

Signs of human habitation begin to appear:

- Narrow, worn footpaths through the jungle.
- Scraped bark on trees, marked intentionally.
- Faint trails of smoke rising into the humid sky.

As they crest a slight ridge, the jungle abruptly ends.

Before them: a broad clearing.

The village — a cluster of huts woven from broad leaves and heavy vines, encircling a central communal area.

The heart of the village is marked by strange symbols and relics:

- An ancient ship’s bell hangs from a wooden frame, heavily corroded but still recognisable.
- Totems carved with abstract wave and storm motifs.
- Shells, bones, and bits of polished driftwood woven into banners.

Villagers move between the huts — lean, weathered figures dressed in plant fibers and decorated with beads, bones, and worn scraps of once-fine cloth.

Their skin tones are diverse, their features a blend of many ancestries — the legacy of the *Summer Bay*'s lost crew.

### First Contact: Maran Scouts

As the players observe:

- A group of warriors emerges from the jungle behind them.
- Painted with muted natural dyes, carrying simple but effective weapons — spears, clubs, slings.

Their leader, a broad-shouldered man with a scar across his jaw, steps forward cautiously.

> **Maran Scout (gruffly, halting English with distorted naval echoes):**
> 
> "Kaptar wish speak. Follow Maran — no harm if no harm."

They gesture for the players to disarm visibly, but do not insist beyond polite caution.

> **GM Notes:**
> - Players complying peacefully are treated cautiously but respectfully.
> - Players resisting or acting aggressively may trigger a tense standoff (but no immediate violence unless escalation continues).

### Moving into the Village

The players are led into the village.

Villagers peer from behind huts. Children scamper to get a better look, wide-eyed.

The tribal leaders wait near the center of the clearing:

- **Kaptar** (tribal chief): A tall, dignified man with a staff topped by a rusted sextant.
- **Surgan** (medicine-man): An older woman carrying a necklace of glass vials and bone charms.
- **Fursmat** (heir): A sharp-eyed youth, proud and watchful, carrying a notched cutlass across his back.

The air is thick with tension — curiosity, not immediate hostility.

### Dialogue: First Meeting

**Kaptar (solemn, slow):**

> "You sea-men. Like fathers’ fathers — come from water. Bring good fortune... or bad?"

**Surgan (tilting her head, inspecting the players):**

> "Skin pale, eyes clear, blood strong. Not spirits. Good."

**Fursmat (warily, arms crossed):**

> "Many seasons past. You come why now?"

The dialect is rough, the vocabulary bent by centuries of isolation — but still recognisable as a distorted descendant of maritime English.

### Player Options

- **Peaceful Greeting**:
  - Speak respectfully.
  - Acknowledge the sea heritage without claiming superiority.
- **Offer Gifts**:
  - Trade goods (mirrors, knives, rope) would greatly impress.
- **Demanding or Arrogant Approach**:
  - Immediate distrust.
  - Heavily guarded interaction.

> **GM Notes:**
> - Encourage players to treat this as a first-contact scenario — cautious, layered, full of cultural gaps.
> - Good diplomacy can unlock easier access to relics and information later.
> - Poor behavior may require serious reputation repair.

### Environmental and Cultural Details

- The ship’s bell has been integrated into rituals — rung before harvests and ceremonies.
- Old navigational charts (in fragments) used as sacred wall coverings.
- Medical bottles and instruments in the Surgan’s hut, treated as holy relics.
- Scraps of ancient uniforms stitched into banners.

The lost culture of the *Summer Bay* is present, but transformed almost beyond recognition.

### Player Misinterpretation Continues

If players mention the "Jagular":

- Villagers fall silent.
- Some make protective gestures.
- Children are ushered away.

After a moment, the Surgan speaks carefully:

> **Surgan (voice low):**
> 
> "Jagular not tribe. Not animal. Not ghost. Forest’s anger, maybe."

An ominous chill settles over the village.

> **GM Notes:**
> - Reinforce that the Jagular is considered a separate, terrifying phenomenon.
> - No one claims it. No one hunts it.

### Scene End Conditions

- Players are invited (cautiously) to camp on the outskirts of the village.
- Future interactions will depend heavily on their conduct during this meeting.
- Next event: Cultural Exchange and Exploration of Tribal Relics.

---

## Major Encounter 8: Cultural Exchange and Exploration of Tribal Relics

### Setting

**Time:** Night, moving into early morning.  
**Weather:** Heavy mist, light intermittent drizzle, muffling sound under the jungle canopy.  
**Location:** Tribal village clearing and various structures within the village.

### Narrative Flow

Following the players' cautious acceptance into the village, a tense but respectful period of cultural exchange begins.

The villagers, while wary, are curious.

Small gestures build bridges:

- Shared food: roasted roots, small jungle fruits, a pungent stew of unknown meat.
- Attempts at simple conversation: halting, but patient.
- Exchanges of small items: polished stones, woven trinkets, bits of driftwood carved into tokens.

The players are regarded as guests — neither trusted nor distrusted yet.

### Exploring the Village: Tribal Relics

If the players behave respectfully, they are permitted (under supervision) to explore certain parts of the village and observe relics of their ancestors.

**Key Relics Observed:**

- **Ship’s Bell**:
  - Still faintly legible if examined closely:
    *"Summer Bay — Verenza Dockyards"*
  - Used in ceremonies to mark seasons and call gatherings.
- **Captain’s Sextant**:
  - Heavily corroded, mounted atop the Kaptar’s ceremonial staff.
  - Symbol of leadership passed down generations.
- **Old Medical Bottles**:
  - Worn glass vials and jars, stored in the Surgan’s hut.
  - Treated as sacred healing relics.
- **Officer’s Sword**:
  - An ornate, salt-pitted blade carried ceremonially by the Sarji (chief warrior).
- **Tattered Charts**:
  - Ancient, fragile navigational maps adorning walls inside important huts.
  - Treated with reverence, though few living remember how to read them.

### Player Opportunities

- **Social Interaction**:
  - Participate in communal activities (assisting with food, tending fires).
  - Share their own stories (simple tales win trust).
- **Skill Rolls**:
  - Diplomacy, Anthropology, or Linguistics rolls improve relations.
  - Gifts of practical items (rope, mirrors, knives) are well received.
- **Investigation**:
  - Careful, respectful inquiry about relics may allow closer examination.
  - Players may spot details (shipyard marks, old engravings) linking the tribe definitively to the *Summer Bay*.

> **GM Notes:**
> - Good behaviour leads to the tribe offering more access.
> - Poor or aggressive behaviour triggers guardedness or quiet withdrawal.

### Access to the Captain’s Logbook

The most critical item — the *Summer Bay*'s Captain’s Logbook — is not immediately shown.

It is kept hidden by the Surgan, stored in a carefully-wrapped bundle of waterproofed leaves and bone charms.

**Conditions for Access**:

- Players must impress or earn trust:
  - Healing assistance (Medicine skill to aid injured villagers).
  - Successful storytelling or respectful cultural exchange.
  - Offering useful gifts without arrogance.

Upon sufficient goodwill:

The Surgan invites the players to her hut, where she unwraps the bundle carefully.

Inside:

- The remains of a leather-bound logbook, swollen and warped by humidity but partially readable.
- Pages scrawled in old but recognisable Varenzan merchant script.

### Character Reactions

**Surgan (solemn, offering the bundle):**

> "This from the first sea-men. Speak truth of water. Speak truth of death."

**Kaptar (standing solemnly by the Surgan's side):**

> "You seek past. Past not always gift. Sometimes curse."

### Player Discoveries from the Logbook

- **Entries describe** initial confusion at impossible stars and navigation failures.
- **Mentions sudden storms** rising from calm seas — catastrophic, ship-breaking tempests.
- **Final entries**:
  - Captain’s decision to run aground to save lives.
  - Notes that no path back to the mainland could be found — and that time itself seemed strange.
  - Reference to something dark beneath the sea:
    *"The ocean holds its breath. And we are forgotten."*

> **GM Notes:**
> - Revelations for Players:
>   - Confirmation that the *Summer Bay* disappeared only a year ago in their time — yet centuries have passed here.
>   - Validation that the Kyngesreach is not merely cursed — it is locked.

### Scene End Conditions

- Players now possess the critical Captain’s Logbook.
- They are armed with proof of time dilation and the nature of the Tidal Lock.
- Future choices:
  - Depart peacefully with relics and knowledge.
  - Attempt deeper alliance with the tribe.
  - Risk confrontation if they attempt to seize more without permission.
- Next event: Resolution and Departure Planning.

## Major Encounter 9: Resolution and Departure Planning

### Setting

**Time:** Following morning, after a tense but successful night in the village.  
**Weather:** Overcast with low, heavy clouds; mist hangs stubbornly among the trees.  
**Location:** Tribal village outskirts and players’ temporary camp.

### Narrative Flow

The dawn creeps in reluctantly, casting the village in washed-out grey light. The jungle beyond is unnervingly quiet.

After the revelations of the Captain’s Log, and the heavy implications of the Tidal Lock, the players — and their NPC allies — must decide their next course of action.

Captain Godfrey calls a private council among the expeditionaries, a few trusted crew, and the players.

### Private Council: Sojourner Officers' Meeting

Gathered around a hastily-cleared patch of earth, Godfrey addresses the group in low, even tones.

> **Captain Godfrey (grim but steady):**
> 
> "This is bigger than we thought. Every ship that came here — it wasn’t bad luck. They couldn’t leave."
> 
> (He glances to the players.)
> 
> "We need answers. Or we'll be one more wreck story on someone else's chart."

He folds his arms and waits.

The decision is, at least partly, in the players' hands.

### Player Choices

- **Depart peacefully**:
  - Take the knowledge and relics gathered.
  - Respect the tribe’s autonomy.
  - Return to the *Sojourner* to regroup and plan the next move.
- **Press further for information or relics**:
  - Risk offending the tribe.
  - Potential escalation into conflict.
- **Forge deeper alliances**:
  - Offer protection, trade goods, or medical knowledge to the tribe.
  - Attempt to gain long-term allies.

> **GM Notes:**
> - Peaceful departure preserves good relations.
> - Aggression or overreach may create future enemies — and hinder later exploration.

### Farewells (If Departing Peacefully)

The tribe assembles quietly at the village edge.

The Kaptar approaches the players, holding a carved driftwood token — shaped roughly like a ship’s wheel.

He presses it into the players’ hands.

> **Kaptar (solemn):**
> 
> "Carry this. Mark of sea-brothers. Safe passage — if sea allows."

Surgan steps forward, touching each player lightly on the forehead with a small feather charm.

> **Surgan (intoning softly):**
> 
> "Memory travels faster than ship. Let good memory guide you."

The Fursmat watches from a distance — respectful, but wary.

### Environmental Atmosphere

- The jungle stirs faintly under the mist.
- Distant bird calls sound muffled and strange.
- The sense of the island — alive, aware — remains.

### Character Reactions

**First Lieutenant Hargrave (quiet, thoughtful):**

> (to players)
> 
> "They survived where others sank. Not just luck. Something binds them to this place."

**Boatswain Iron Meg (gruff, shouldering gear):**

> "Next time we anchor, make sure it’s not on a ghost’s doorstep."

**Nyxie**:

- Pads back to the boats willingly.
- Her tail, for once, is low — thoughtful rather than agitated.

### Final Detail: The Captain’s Last Observation

As they push the boats back toward the water, Captain Godfrey lingers at the treeline a moment longer.

His gaze sweeps the jungle, the village, the distant ship swaying gently at anchor.

Under his breath, only barely audible:

> **Captain Godfrey:**
> 
> "We’re not done with this place. Not by half."

Then he turns and joins the others.

### Scene End Conditions

- Players successfully depart with crucial knowledge about the Tidal Lock.
- Players maintain positive relations with the island tribe.
- The stage is set for future exploration — and eventual confrontation with the deeper forces at work in the Kyngesreach.

- Adventure Conclusion: Return to the Sojourner and planning next steps.
