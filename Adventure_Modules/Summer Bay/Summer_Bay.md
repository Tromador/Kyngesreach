# The Lost Legacy of the Summer Bay (Phase 1 Raw Collation)

---

## Adventure Goals

- Introduce the Tidal Lock via the Summer Bay’s fate.
- Establish the Kyngesreach as a magically isolated space.
- Introduce the concept of time dilation and other supernatural distortions.
- Let the players discover a primitive tribe descended from a vanished ship.
- Provide a compelling, exploration-forward session with potential combat, roleplay, and survival challenges.

---

## Godfrey’s Speech – Crossing into the Kyngesreach

> “Right. Listen sharp.  
>
> Tomorrow morning, we cross into the **Kyngesreach**. The charts will still call it that, but for most sailors, it’s only ever been a name on the edge of the map. Stories wrapped in fog. Warnings passed around over grog. Most never get close.  
>
> We do.  
>
> We are not the first to pass this way. But we aim to be the first to do it on purpose, and with eyes open.  
>
> I won’t insult you by pretending it’s just another leg of the journey. It’s not. The Reach is a place where things stop making sense—and start making legends. The kind that end in songs, or in silence.  
>
> But we are not a drifting sloop chasing rumours. We are the *Sojourner*. And she is no myth. She’s fast, she’s solid, and she’s crewed by the sharpest, meanest, most bloody-minded lot I’ve had the pleasure of commanding.  
>
> We’ve got riggers who could thread a needle in a gale, marines who stand like iron, and enough sailors who know when to shut up and listen. That’s enough for me.  
>
> Tonight, check your kit. Square your locker. Say your prayers or swear your oaths, whichever gets you through the dark.  
>
> Tomorrow, we go where few ever return from.  
>
> And we do it with **backs straight and hands steady**.  
>
> *Dismissed.”*

## Crossing the Threshold

Biele’s prophetic episode marks their entry into the Reach.

> *“The sea holds its breath. Stars lie. No path leads back from here.”*

---

## First Landfall – Jungle Island

- Humid, oppressive, alive with unfamiliar sounds and smells.
- Jungle climate despite nearby temperate waters (geographic weirdness).
- Players find a shipwreck that appears **centuries old** but built in **modern style**.
- No identifying marks. Crew can’t tell what ship it is yet.
- Skill rolls (Seamanship, Carpentry) confirm mismatch between condition and age.
- Beach shows tracks of humans and animals (wild pigs, tapirs).

---

## Island Exploration – Structured Stages

### Stage 1: First Impressions & Beach

- Dense humidity, clinging air, unfamiliar floral scents.
- Shipwreck remnants (porcelain, copper fittings, rusted iron).
- Animal and humanoid tracks.
- Entry point for jungle exploration.

---

### Stage 2: Jungle Exploration & Immersion

- Narrow paths, roots, swampy ground.
- Travel rolls (Survival, Acrobatics) to progress without fatigue or incident.
- Oversized flowers, sticky vines, swampy pools buzzing with insects.

**Optional Minor Encounters:**

- Insect swarm: morale penalty or minor fatigue.
- Monkey/bird observation: colourful, noisy, curious.
- Tribal effigy (wood idol): players may misread it.
- Quicksand hazard: teamwork rescue.

**Signs of being watched:**

- Foliage movement, faint footsteps.
- Biele: *“We’re not alone.”*

---

### Stage 3: Pig Encounter & Food Logistics

#### Pig Encounter

- Wild boars in the jungle: encountered by accident or during hunt.
- May charge if provoked or surprised.
- Provides meat, introduces survival logistics.

**GURPS Stats – Wild Pig:**

- ST 13, DX 11, IQ 3, HT 13
- HP 13, Move 7, DR 2
- Tusks 1d+2 imp, Slam 2d-1 cr
- Traits: Bad Temper, Berserk, Extra Fat
- Skills: Brawling 12, Survival 11

#### Meat Yield

- Avg boar (100 kg live weight) yields ~60 kg usable meat.
- Enough for ~120 full rations (0.5 kg each).
- Feeds full Sojourner crew (~170) for half a day.
- More pigs = morale boost + potential reserves.

---

#### Smoking & Preservation System

Preservation is vital — no refrigeration.

**Preservation Methods (ranked):**

- **Smoking:** Most viable. Jungle wood available.
  - Build frame (Carpentry), control fire (Cooking), rotate meat (Housekeeping).
  - 1 pig takes 8–12 hours.
  - Up to 2/day possible with effort.
- **Salting:** If salt is available. May be limited.
- **Sun-drying:** NOT viable in rainforest.
- **Eat fresh:** Boost morale but nothing preserved.

**Summary Table:**

| Method    | Prep Time | Risk | Longevity | Supplies Needed |
|-----------|-----------|------|-----------|------------------|
| Smoking   | Moderate  | Low  | 5–10 days | Wood, work crew  |
| Salting   | High      | Low  | Weeks     | Salt, barrels    |
| Eat Fresh | None      | None | 0         | Fire, cook       |

---

**Narrative Flavour:**

> *Cookie (grinning with cleaver in hand):*  
> “You get me three more of these, and I’ll stop cooking biscuits like bricks.”

> *Mallory (eyeing the jungle):*  
> “You heard the man. Bag the pigs, smoke the meat. And don’t get eaten.”

---

**Marine Hunting Detail (Optional Side Quest)**

- Squad of marines led by a player or NPC.
- Roll Tracking, Survival, or Tactics.
- **Success:** 1–3 pigs caught.
- **Failure:** Injury, lost trail.
- **Crit Failure:** Attacked by something worse (Jagular?).

---
---

## Stage 4: Jagular Encounters

### Early Signs

- Word “Jagular” carved into driftwood, etched on a tree idol.
- Players misinterpret it:
  > “Maybe it’s their Sarji?”  
  > “Clearly a dialect form of 'juggler'. Expect acrobatics.”

- Later, Nyxie growls at the trees. Biele shivers.
  > *"Something is following us."*

---

### First Jagular Incident – Disruption

- Pig carcass disappears.
- Smoking frame knocked over.
- Deep gouges on a nearby tree.
- No footprints. Smell of musk and wet ash.

---

### Optional Combat Encounter – Jagular Ambush

- Surprise drop from above (ambush from tree).
- Targets an isolated player or marine.
- May retreat if injured.
- Can return later—becomes an environmental threat.

---

### Jagular Stats – GURPS

**Jagular (Panthera botherensis)**

- ST 18, DX 13, IQ 4, HT 15  
- HP 20, Per 15, Will 12, FP 15  
- Move 10, Speed 7.0, DR 2  
- SM 0

**Traits:**  
- Combat Reflexes, Enhanced Dodge 1  
- Acute Hearing 3, Night Vision 6  
- Mild Temporal Dislocation (acts unpredictably)  
- Ambush Predator, Catfall, Bad Temper (12)  
- “Oh Bother” Aura – Will-2 check or -1 to defense first round  
- Magical Affinity – senses enchanted items

**Attacks:**  
- Claws: 1d+3 cut  
- Bite: 2d+1 imp  
- Drop From Above: +2 to hit, +1d damage on first strike

**Behaviour:**
- Watches from the trees.
- Steals food. Spreads fear.
- Tribal villagers fear it deeply.

---

### Tribal Interpretation

> *“Jagular not tribe. Not animal. Not ghost. Forest’s anger, maybe.”*

---

## Stage 5: Discovery of the Tribe

After surviving the jungle, players observe:

- Crude but orderly huts made from woven leaves and jungle vines.
- Cooking fires, drying racks, small children playing.
- In the centre: a **corroded bell** with faint inscription:  
  > *“Summer Bay — Verenza Dockyards”*

---

## Stage 6: First Contact with the Tribe

**Intercepted by Maran warriors**, led by a **Sarji**.

They speak a **distorted dialect** derived from naval terms.

> *“Kaptar wish speak. Follow Maran. No harm if no harm.”*

---

### Cultural Roles (Lexicon)

| Word      | Meaning         | Root Word     |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| Kaptar    | Chief            | Captain       |
| Fursmat   | Heir             | First Mate    |
| Surgan    | Healer           | Surgeon       |
| Sarji     | War Leader       | Sergeant      |
| Maran     | Warrior caste    | Marines       |

---

### Audience with the Kaptar, Surgan, and Fursmat

**Dialogue Samples:**

> **Kaptar:**  
> “You sea-men. Like fathers’ fathers—come from water. Bring good fortune or bad?”

> **Surgan (assessing them):**  
> “Skin pale, eyes clear, blood strong. Not spirits. Good.”

> **Fursmat (suspicious):**  
> “Many seasons past. You come why now?”

**Roleplay Mechanics:**
- Cultural missteps risk being barred from the village.
- Polite behaviour and respectful interest are rewarded.
- Sharing stories builds trust.

---

## Stage 7: Cultural Exchange

**Relics of the Summer Bay (viewed or offered):**

- Captain’s sextant (symbol of power)
- Officer’s blade (held by Sarji)
- Medicine bottles (Surgan’s tools)
- Glassware, copper tools, carved ornaments

**The Logbook:**
- Held sacred by the Surgan
- Wrapped in waterproof leaves in a carved box
- Only offered if deep trust is earned

---

### Example Logbook Entries

> *“The stars are wrong. We corrected twice but the sea will not yield.”*  
> *“Crew light-headed. Spirits low.”*  
> *“Storm came out of nowhere. No wind, then death.”*  
> *“We cannot breach the Reach. We run her aground to survive.”*

---

## Stage 8: The Decision

**Players must convince the tribe to part with the logbook:**

Options:
- Offer tools, salt, mirrors, medical aid.
- Appeal to ancestral honour.
- Steal it (risky).
- Fight for it (deadly, guerrilla response).

---

## Stage 9: Return and Revelation

Players return to the *Sojourner* with the logbook.

> **Godfrey:**  
> “Summer Bay? She vanished not a year ago. No sign. Not until now.”

> **Later (reading):**  
> “So now we know. We’re not explorers. We’re prisoners. Same as they were.”

Biele is quiet. Nyxie sits on the bell, tail twitching.

## GM Tools, Notes, and Timing Breakdown

---

### GM Tips to Manage Pacing

- Adjust encounter count and size based on session speed.
- Use Nyxie’s behaviour, Biele’s senses, and Cookie’s mood as environmental “tells.”
- Lean into the sensory texture of the jungle: smell, heat, sweat, noise.
- Present tribe encounter as tense but fair — give players a sense they *can* win respect.

---

### Optional Future Hooks

- The tribe becomes recurring NPCs — potential allies or rivals.
- The Jagular could return on another island (or have offspring).
- Other wrecks from the ship list may appear.
- A second, more intact ship might be discovered — a potential escape vehicle?
- Investigating the Stormcallers’ involvement in sending ships into the Reach.
- Trying to leave the Reach and confronting the Tidal Lock directly (a future arc).
