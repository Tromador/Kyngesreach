## Adventure Structure

### Scene 1: Captain Godfrey’s Speech

> “Right. Listen sharp.  
>
> Tomorrow morning, we cross into the **Kyngesreach**. The charts will still call it that, but for most sailors, it’s only ever been a name on the edge of the map. Stories wrapped in fog. Warnings passed around over grog. Most never get close.  
>
> We do.  
>
> We are not the first to pass this way. But we aim to be the first to do it on purpose, and with eyes open.  
>
> I won’t insult you by pretending it’s just another leg of the journey. It’s not. The Reach is a place where things stop making sense—and start making legends. The kind that end in songs, or in silence.  
>
> But we are not a drifting sloop chasing rumours. We are the *Sojourner*. And she is no myth. She’s fast, she’s solid, and she’s crewed by the sharpest, meanest, most bloody-minded lot I’ve had the pleasure of commanding.  
>
> We’ve got riggers who could thread a needle in a gale, marines who stand like iron, and enough sailors who know when to shut up and listen. That’s enough for me.  
>
> Tonight, check your kit. Square your locker. Say your prayers or swear your oaths, whichever gets you through the dark.  
>
> Tomorrow, we go where few ever return from.  
>
> And we do it with **backs straight and hands steady**.  
>
> *Dismissed.”*

### Scene 2: Crossing the Threshold

Use Biele's "episode" to give a subtle but eerie indicator that the ship has passed through the Tidal Lock's boundary.

> Biele suddenly sways, eyes rolling back, her voice becoming hollow and echoing:  
> *"The sea holds its breath. Stars lie. No path leads back from here."*

She collapses briefly, then returns confused, unsure of what occurred.

---

### Scene 3: First Landfall (Wreck of the Summer Bay)

- Hull mostly rotten away, fragments of wood embedded in sand, vegetation grown around ship's ribs.

---

**Social Mechanics:**

---

#### Stage 8: Decision Point (Diplomacy vs. Conflict) (15–20 mins)

- Risk discovery by Sarji or Maran.
- Conflict triggers: tribal ambush, jungle pursuit.

**Combat Encounter:**

- Hit-and-run tactics from the Maran.

- Players may need to fight their way out or retreat and regroup.

---

#### Stage 9: Wrap-Up and Transition (5–10 mins)

**Return to the Sojourner:**

- Players return with relics or memory.
- Godfrey assembles officers for private discussion.

> **Godfrey:**  
> “Well done. This tells us exactly what we're dealing with. Let's not waste it.”

> **Godfrey (on logbook):**  
> “Summer Bay? She vanished not a year ago. No sign. Not until now.”

> **Godfrey (final):**  
> “So now we know. We’re not just explorers. We’re prisoners. Same as they were.”

**Biele:**
- Distant, thoughtful. May offer cryptic insight.
- Nyxie perches beside her, tail twitching.

## GM Tools and Notes

### Pacing Tips

- Control momentum via jungle density, dialogue, and ritual timing.
- Use NPCs (Nyxie, Biele, Cookie) for mood and pacing cues.
- Adjust tribe openness depending on player caution or boldness.

### Roleplay Levers

- Use tribal vocabulary inconsistencies to reward player attention.
- Allow clever use of items for barter (e.g., surgical alcohol = trade good).
- Use environmental signs to foreshadow future threats (e.g., another wreck).
