# Tomorrow’s Tide - Kyngesreach Campaign Adventure Module

## Adventure Overview
The players circumnavigate the mysterious jungle island, mapping its coastline. They encounter legendary explorer Captain Sir Lucien Harrow, stranded from his perspective only recently—though he vanished over 250 years ago. Investigating a Stormcaller ritual site guarded by hostile Drowned warriors reveals valuable clues about the mysterious Stormcaller cult. Meanwhile, the formerly hostile Jagulars unexpectedly intervene to assist the players.

## Adventure Introduction

**Opening Scene: Quarterdeck, the morning of the island circumnavigation**

> **Captain Elias Godfrey (on the quarterdeck, calm and clear):**
> 
> “We’re not leaving. That much we’ve learned.
> 
> So we do what sailors do when they can't go forward. We go around.
> 
> This island—we don’t know its name. The maps don’t hold it. The stars above it turn sideways, and the compass spins like a drunk with a grudge. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be charted.
> 
> What we can see, we record. What we can’t, we mark by its absence. That’s how you make sense of something that doesn’t want to be known.
> 
> The jungle's already taken a swing at us. So has the sea. We’re still here.
> 
> From here on, it’s coastal runs and sounding lines. We hug the shoreline, we log every inlet, and we don’t assume the rocks today will be the same shape tomorrow.
> 
> If your head aches when you look at the stars—note it. If the sky tells you three things and none of them agree—write down all three. Patterns show up where facts refuse to.
> 
> And listen to Biele. If she says something’s wrong with the air, treat it like the rigging’s groaning before a blow.
> 
> This island wants to be forgotten. That’s why we remember. That’s why we draw every line twice.
> 
> We’re not lost. Not yet. And I don’t plan on learning how to be.
> 
> Let’s get to it.”

## Adventure Scenes

### Scene 1: Charting the Coastline
- Players begin coastal mapping with navigation difficulties due to Stormcaller obfuscation magic.
- Skill checks (Navigation, Astronomy, IQ-based rolls) are required.
- Highlight Biele’s specialist cartography skills and weather-magic sensitivity.

### Scene 2: Smoke Signal
- Players spot controlled smoke signals along a remote beach.
- A neat survival camp reveals recent habitation by a skilled mariner.

### Scene 3: Meeting Sir Lucien Harrow
- Encounter Captain Sir Lucien Harrow, legendary explorer.
- Harrow vanished 250 years ago but believes himself recently stranded. Players realise the inverted temporal paradox.
- Harrow is intrigued and puzzled by the players' "modern" equipment (especially firearms).

### Scene 4: Jagular Ambiguity
- Jagular pack stalks the players covertly, growling and rustling foliage without clear sightlines for ranged attacks.
- Players remain wary and ready for combat, frustrated by elusive targets.

### Scene 5: The Saltwatch Circle
**Location:** Windswept clifftop overlooking the open sea—exposed, lonely, atmospheric.

**Description:**
- Ring of rough-carved standing stones, mossy and salt-streaked.
- Symbols etched deeply: wave patterns, swirling stars, abstract storms and tides.
- Raised central stone dais with intricate motifs.
- Broken maritime offerings: ancient rope, driftwood, coral, sea-polished shells.

**Sensory Details:**
- Strong, briny winds whistle and moan.
- Salt spray stings eyes and skin; air tastes of the ocean.
- Echoes of crashing waves below add isolation and reverence.

**Purpose:**
- Ritual site related to weather, tides, navigation.
- Biele detects residual Stormcaller weather magic.
- Skill rolls (Occultism, Thaumatology, Weather Magic) reveal obfuscation spells preventing accurate navigation.

### Scene 6: Ambush of the Drowned (with revised Jagular notes)

**GM Running Guidance: Handling Jagular Allies (Revised Final)**

Step 1: Jagular Presence Without Visibility
- First describe low growls, rustling bushes, and glimpses of fur in the dense undergrowth. No clear line of fire. Players feel stalked but never see the full shape.

Step 2: Players’ Readiness as Part of the Drama
- Players likely ready weapons, nervously trying to sight targets. Let this tension sit for a beat or two, then escalate.

Step 3: Immediate Transition to Drowned Ambush
- At peak player frustration, trigger the ambush from the Drowned emerging from a different direction. Players must immediately divert attention and fight for survival.

Step 4: Jagular Intervention – Ambiguous Entry
- Mid-combat, thick brush explodes as the Jagulars finally reveal themselves.
- Describe a terrifying charge: powerful feline shapes, teeth and claws bared, leaping directly toward the melee. Players should believe the worst has happened.

Step 5: Dice Reveal the Truth
- As the first Jagular hits, narrate it bypassing or ignoring players completely to violently tackle the nearest Drowned.
- All Jagulars fight Drowned exclusively. They will even body-block between the players and their foes.
- Players will quickly understand the Jagulars are aiding them, not attacking.

Combat Notes:
- Slippery footing and dangerous cliff edges remain.
- Apply standard Drowned warrior and Jagular stat blocks.
- Maintain high narrative intensity throughout.

**Combat Details:**
- Slippery footing, cliff edges (fall risk), strong winds (DX -1 to ranged).
- Drowned Stat Block:
  - ST 12 DX 11 IQ 9 HT 12, HP 14 FP 12, DR 1+2 (natural/leather)
  - Rusted Cutlass (1d+2 cutting), Grapple, Doesn’t Breathe, High Pain Threshold.
- Jagular Stat Block:
  - ST 15 DX 14 IQ 4 HT 13, HP 17, DR 1
  - Claw (1d+2 cutting), Bite (1d+1 impaling), Enhanced Move, Night Vision, "Oh Bother" aura (Will-2 or -1 defence first round).

### Scene 7: Post-Combat Investigation
- Players find matching Stormcaller symbols on Drowned tattoos and Saltwatch stones.
- Biele detects deliberate interference woven into the site’s magic.
- First concrete evidence of Stormcaller activity.

### Scene 8: Harrow’s Historical Insight
- Harrow recognises the symbols, visibly unsettled.
- Recounts legends of sea-mages called "Saltwatches" who aided lost mariners.
- Suggests internal corruption or schism within the Stormcallers.

### Scene 9: Departure and Reflection
- Players complete coastal mapping and return to the *Sojourner*.
- Harrow joins the crew, welcomed cautiously by Godfrey.
- Players left to wonder if they have also shifted in time.
