## Adventure Overview
The players circumnavigate the mysterious jungle island, mapping its coastline. They encounter legendary explorer Captain Sir Lucien Harrow, stranded from his perspective only recently—though he vanished over 250 years ago. Investigating a Stormcaller ritual site guarded by hostile Drowned warriors reveals valuable clues about the mysterious Stormcaller cult.

## Adventure Introduction

**Opening Scene: Quarterdeck, the morning of the island circumnavigation**

> **Captain Elias Godfrey (on the quarterdeck, calm and clear):**
> 
> “We’re not leaving. That much we’ve learned.
> 
> So we do what sailors do when they can't go forward. We go around.
> 
> This island—we don’t know its name. The maps don’t hold it. The stars above it turn sideways, and the compass spins like a drunk with a grudge. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be charted.
> 
> What we can see, we record. What we can’t, we mark by its absence. That’s how you make sense of something that doesn’t want to be known.
> 
> The jungle's already taken a swing at us. So has the sea. We’re still here.
> 
> From here on, it’s coastal runs and sounding lines. We hug the shoreline, we log every inlet, and we don’t assume the rocks today will be the same shape tomorrow.
> 
> If your head aches when you look at the stars—note it. If the sky tells you three things and none of them agree—write down all three. Patterns show up where facts refuse to.
> 
> And listen to Biele. If she says something’s wrong with the air, treat it like the rigging’s groaning before a blow.
> 
> This island wants to be forgotten. That’s why we remember. That’s why we draw every line twice.
> 
> We’re not lost. Not yet. And I don’t plan on learning how to be.
> 
> Let’s get to it.”
