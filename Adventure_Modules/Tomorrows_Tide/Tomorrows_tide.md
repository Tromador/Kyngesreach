# Tomorrow's Tide

## Adventure Overview
The players circumnavigate the mysterious jungle island, mapping its coastline. They encounter legendary explorer Captain Sir Lucien Harrow, stranded from his perspective only recently—though he vanished over 250 years ago. Investigating a Stormcaller ritual site guarded by hostile Drowned warriors reveals valuable clues about the mysterious Stormcaller cult. Meanwhile, the formerly hostile Jagulars unexpectedly intervene to assist the players.

- First concrete proof of Stormcaller activity (symbol matches tattoos).

---

### Scene 8: Harrow's Historical Insight
- Harrow recognises symbols from Saltwatch Circle and Drowned tattoos.
- Recounts vague historical legends about benevolent sea-mages who withdrew into isolation. Stories were viewed with skepticism even in his time.

## Optional Details (Use or Remove as Desired)

### Harrow's Equipment (Curiosities and Relics)
- Antique naval sextant, pristine but outdated maps.
- Elaborately carved antique pistol (single-shot matchlock)—mostly ceremonial given limited ammunition.
- Personal journal with historical notations valuable to scholars.

### Environmental Hazards (Clifftop)
- Severe gusts of wind (DX check or risk losing small carried items).
- Cliff edges requiring DX or Acrobatics roll if engaged in combat near edge.

### Roleplaying Opportunities

- Captain Godfrey's caution about potential paradox caused by Harrow’s presence.

### Additional Player Clues
- Symbols at Saltwatch Circle match those tattooed on Drowned and seen on the earlier encountered idol ("Jagular"), implying a deeper, layered connection.

## GM Tips & Notes
- Maintain tension during Jagular encounters by limiting clear visual opportunities for attacks, preserving surprise reversal during combat.
- Reinforce players' growing suspicion and intrigue regarding the Stormcallers' true nature and intentions.
- Highlight Biele’s weather-magic proficiency and cartography role throughout to keep player agency strong.
