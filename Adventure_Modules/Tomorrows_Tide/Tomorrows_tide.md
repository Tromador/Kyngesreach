# Tomorrow’s Tide - Kyngesreach Campaign Adventure Module

## Adventure Overview
The players circumnavigate the mysterious jungle island, mapping its coastline. They encounter legendary explorer Captain Sir Lucien Harrow, stranded from his perspective only recently—though he vanished over 250 years ago. Investigating a Stormcaller ritual site guarded by hostile Drowned warriors reveals valuable clues about the mysterious Stormcaller cult. Meanwhile, the formerly hostile Jagulars unexpectedly intervene to assist the players.

## Scene 1 - Adventure Introduction

**Opening Scene: Quarterdeck, the morning of the island circumnavigation**

> **Captain Elias Godfrey (on the quarterdeck, calm and clear):**
> 
> “We’re not leaving. That much we’ve learned.
> 
> So we do what sailors do when they can't go forward. We go around.
> 
> This island—we don’t know its name. The maps don’t hold it. The stars above it turn sideways, and the compass spins like a drunk with a grudge. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be charted.
> 
> What we can see, we record. What we can’t, we mark by its absence. That’s how you make sense of something that doesn’t want to be known.
> 
> The jungle's already taken a swing at us. So has the sea. We’re still here.
> 
> From here on, it’s coastal runs and sounding lines. We hug the shoreline, we log every inlet, and we don’t assume the rocks today will be the same shape tomorrow.
> 
> If your head aches when you look at the stars—note it. If the sky tells you three things and none of them agree—write down all three. Patterns show up where facts refuse to.
> 
> And listen to Biele. If she says something’s wrong with the air, treat it like the rigging’s groaning before a blow.
> 
> This island wants to be forgotten. That’s why we remember. That’s why we draw every line twice.
> 
> We’re not lost. Not yet. And I don’t plan on learning how to be.
> 
> Let’s get to it.”

## Adventure Scenes

## Scene 2: Return to the Summer Bay Village

### Scene Purpose
The players previously expressed intent (AAR) to revisit the descendants of the *Summer Bay* crew to ask about the island before beginning their circumnavigation.  
This scene occurs **immediately after Godfrey’s briefing** and before the coastal survey expedition.

---

### Setting: The Jungle Trail to the Village

The players depart from the *Sojourner’s* beach camp.  
The humid jungle seems thicker than before. Mist hangs in heavy curtains. The chirr of insects fills the oppressive silence.  
Crew members accompanying the party clear the worst of the undergrowth with machetes.

> *The ground softens underfoot as they reach familiar territory. Dripping leaves brush damp trails across clothing. Somewhere nearby, something unseen crashes noisily through the undergrowth—then falls silent again.*

No encounters unless the GM chooses to insert them.

---

### Arrival at the Village

The clearing opens before them; simple raised huts, smoke from cookfires twisting in the still air, faded scraps of cloth fluttering weakly from ropes.  
The villagers are already watching, standing silent, cautious but not hostile.  
Children whisper and point from behind shelters. The adults wait for the players to speak first.

---

### Roleplay Interaction: Key NPC Dialogue

#### Kaptar (village chief)
> *“You return again. The sea has not taken you. Why do you seek us now?”*

#### Surgan (elder woman, healer)
> *“You wish to map the island? Brave. Or foolish. The land here does not stay where it belongs.”*  
> *“The Saltwatch once held the shores fast. They are gone. The stones remain. The winds whisper there still.”*

#### Fursmat (young warrior)
Says nothing at first; stands at the rear with wary eyes on the group.

---

### Player Enquiries

The villagers offer warnings, not guidance:
- “The island moves.”
- “Shorelines vanish.”
- “Reefs appear where none were.”
- “Currents run backwards under the full moon.”
- “The jagulars watch. They are not to be disturbed.”

If players ask about the “Saltwatch”:
> *“A place of standing stones. On the far side of the island. We do not go there.”*

(This is a foreshadow for **Scene 7: The Saltwatch Circle**.)

---

### Optional RP Outcome

As a sign of respect, the Kaptar presents the players with a small carved driftwood token:
- Shaped like a stylised wheel or compass rose.  
- Purely narrative; no mechanical bonus.

> *“Carry this. It remembers those who came before. Memory sometimes guides better than stars.”*

Players may attach it to the *Sojourner*’s wheel or keep it as a personal keepsake.

---

### Scene End & Transition

The players return to the *Sojourner* beach camp at any time.  
The crew makes final preparations for coastal mapping.  
This leads directly to **Scene 3: Charting the Coastline**.

> *As they step from the oppressive heat of the jungle back to the sea breeze, Nyxie pads out from under a boat and stares at them expectantly.*

---

**[End of Scene 2: Return to the Summer Bay Village]**

### Scene 3: Charting the Coastline

### Scene Purpose
The *Sojourner* begins its slow voyage around the perimeter of the island.  
Players are tasked with documenting landmarks, sketching charts, and attempting to produce the first true map of this shifting coastline.

---

### Setting: Aboard the *Sojourner*

> The sails creak faintly overhead, sagging in strange listless air. The jungle looms close to port and starboard both, a dark tangled wall that seems to lean over the sea like a living thing. The sun hangs low and sullen behind smears of high cloud; what little light filters down feels pale and uncertain.
> 
> As the *Sojourner* eases forward, the water itself seems to resist. Waves pull at the hull from unexpected angles. The compass spins once, twice, then settles pointing somewhere between north and nowhere at all.
> 
> Far overhead, seabirds wheel in tight, nervous circles. The faint slap of water against the hull is the only constant sound.
> 
> Behind the players, the anchor lies useless on the deck. There is no point in lowering it. Even if they stopped now, there is no guarantee they would find the same coastline when they raised it again.
> 
> The survey begins.

The early morning air is thick and heavy. A false calm hangs over the water as the ship pulls away from its temporary anchorage.

The jungle presses down to the water’s edge, tangled and oppressive.  
Grey-green waves lap listlessly against rock and sand.  
Distant cries of unseen birds echo under a heavy sky.  
The sea feels... wrong. Something about its texture and movement is subtly off.

> *“The water here runs sluggish yet restless. Ropes drag oddly when hauled. The sails behave as if confused, billowing against no discernible breeze.”*

Crew morale is tense but determined.

**Optional GM flavour (at player request):**
- The wake of the *Sojourner* twists and braids unnaturally behind her.  
- Compass needles spin, stop, and spin again.  
- Occasional wisps of mist rise suddenly from the water then vanish.  
- The shoreline itself seems subtly inconsistent: beaches lengthen, cliffs shift angles, forest edges advance or retreat.  

---

### Player Activity: The Survey

Players must decide:
- Who takes responsibility for navigation and plotting.  
- How to divide tasks (e.g. Biele plotting, others using sounding lines, lookout duty).

This scene is designed for **problem-solving and teamwork**.

#### Skill Rolls
Primary skills:  
- **Navigation (Sea)**  
- **Cartography**  
- **Seamanship**  
- **Perception**  

Supporting skills:
- **Astronomy**  
- **Mathematics (Surveying)**  
- **Weather Sense** (can warn of approaching distortion pockets)

**GM Note:**  
Success = players manage to produce rough but usable coastal sketches.  
Failure = charts become wildly contradictory, players must backtrack, or even risk grounding on unexpected reefs.

---

### Subtle Anomaly Event (Narrative)

Regardless of rolls, one major phenomenon occurs:
- Players realise features they passed earlier (such as a distinctive rock formation or inlet) are **gone when viewed again an hour later**, or **appear twice** where there should only be one.

**GM example lines:**
> *“The bay entrance you just sketched... no longer exists. It is a sheer cliff now.”*  
> *“The reef dead ahead is identical to one you passed already this morning—but your log shows you should be miles away.”*  
> *“Biele stares at the stars in frustration: none match the charts, or even each other.”*

This is the **first hard experience of the “shifting island” effect** (hidden Stormcaller disruption; players remain unaware of the cause).

---

### Highlight: Biele’s Abilities

Players will quickly discover that Biele’s unique sensitivity and mapping skill stabilises the data:
- If Biele makes a successful **Cartography or Navigation roll**, the ship avoids doubling back or becoming trapped in false loops.  
- If she fails, the ship may spend extra hours sailing in circles.

> *“Captain Godfrey watches grimly as Biele frowns at her charts, muttering under her breath and repeatedly redrawing the same jagged coastline segment with growing irritation.”*

This strongly reinforces Biele as the crew’s best (and perhaps only) guide in these waters.

---

### Optional Player Dialogue Prompts

Encourage players to engage:
- “Do you trust Biele’s instincts or double-check her work?”  
- “Do you want to sail closer inshore for better landmarks, or stay offshore for safety?”  
- “Do you try to record the impossible changes... or only what seems to stay put?”

There is no right answer; this builds player immersion.

---

### Scene Conclusion

After several exhausting hours the players manage to piece together a rough but unstable perimeter outline.

The coastline mapped so far:
- Feels untrustworthy.  
- May not match reality tomorrow.  
- But it’s the only chart they have.

> *“The last rays of sun filter weakly through leaden clouds. The crew ties off the last sounding line with relief, yet cannot shake the sensation that the ship has sailed through a place that was watching them all along.”*

Transition to next scene:
- Players spot a thin vertical plume of smoke rising faintly from a distant beach (leads to **Scene 4: Smoke Signal**).

---

### GM Sidebar: Spotlight on Biele – Scene 3

> **Use this encounter to gently bring Biele’s player forward.**  
> The player has sometimes remained in the background in past sessions; this is an ideal low-risk, high-importance spotlight moment.

Biele’s character build is uniquely suited to this scene:
- **Cartography 14** → best mapmaker aboard.  
- **Navigation (Sea) 14** → most skilled navigator.  
- **Weather Sense 14** → likely the first to sense atmospheric anomalies.  
- **Danger Sense (Advantage)** → perfect trigger for pre-warning of any unexplained spatial shifts.

Encourage Biele’s player by:
- Asking directly for her decisions: *“Biele, are you steering by the stars or the coastline?”*  
- Letting her make **exclusive rolls** to stabilise charts or avoid false landmarks.  
- Having NPCs (even Godfrey) defer to her judgment reluctantly:  
    > *“I don’t like trusting to magic, but... what does Biele say?”*

This is her first real test as the crew’s navigator in truly unnatural waters.  
A successful showing here naturally sets the tone for Biele’s central role throughout *Tomorrow’s Tide*.

> **GM Tip:**  
> Even on a failure, frame her as having made the best call under impossible conditions: *“The island moved after you mapped it. You were right; the sea itself cheated.”*

---

**[End of Scene 3: Charting the Coastline]**

## Scene 3a: The Dead Calm

### Scene Purpose
Provide a tense, atmospheric encounter that both gives Biele a magical spotlight moment and allows the rest of the party to actively contribute.  
The encounter also foreshadows that the players are being watched or interfered with by unseen forces, escalating the campaign mystery.

This scene occurs between Scene 3 (charting the coastline) and Scene 4 (smoke signal).

---

### Setting: Midday, Offshore

The *Sojourner* glides smoothly through calm seas under a leaden grey sky.  
The jungle ridge is a dark smudge on the horizon. The sails snap once—and fall utterly limp.  
The wind dies completely.  

The water goes mirror-still.  
An oppressive silence descends.

---

### Narration Box: The Sea Holds Its Breath

> Without warning, the wind dies. Not fades. Dies. The sails sag like collapsed lungs.  
> 
> The wake behind the ship fades instantly to nothing. The surface of the water becomes glassy and motionless.  
> 
> No bird calls. No distant waves. Even the rigging stops creaking. The air itself feels thick and heavy, as though the entire ocean is holding its breath.  
> 
> Then, below deck, Ohaku the dog begins to whine. A long, low sound that rises into an uneasy, mournful howl.  
> 
> A heartbeat later, Nyxie hisses violently, tail puffing out like a bottlebrush. She bolts under a coil of rope, vanishing into shadow.  
> 
> Biele freezes mid-step as a violent, overwhelming sense of wrongness washes over her like ice water. Every instinct screams that something is terribly, impossibly wrong.  
> 
> The crew mutter nervously. Several cross themselves or tap the mast.  
> 
> Something is here.

---

### Event Sequence

**1. Crew panic and indecision**
- Godfrey stays calm, but crew and players feel growing unease.
- No stars, no breeze, no sound.  
- The ship drifts motionless.

**2. Biele acts**
- Biele declares she will cast **Favourable Wind**.
- The spell works—but it feels *wrong*. As soon as she channels magic, she feels a hostile force pushing back.
- The air crackles faintly, static arcs across rigging.  
- Biele grits her teeth and *forces* the wind through sheer willpower, succeeding but at **double fatigue cost**.

**GM Description:**  
> *“The sails tremble, lurch, fall still… then with a snap they fill with ragged, choppy gusts. The ship begins to move, but sluggishly, as if some vast invisible hand reluctantly let go.”*

---

### Complication Events (Party Involvement)

While Biele casts:
- The ship becomes unstable, lines whip free, chaos erupts:
    - A **rope suddenly snaps** → any player can grab and secure it (**DX or Seamanship roll**).  
    - A sudden **lightning strike hits the mainsail** → small fire starts on rigging. Players must react fast (**DX, Seamanship, or improvised teamwork**).  
        - *As the afterimage burns into your vision, you swear—just for an instant—you saw the twisted arc trace an impossible shape, something jagged yet disturbingly symmetrical, like a sigil or glyph… and then it’s gone.*  
    - A heavy **spar swings loose toward Biele**, threatening to crush or sweep her overboard. Another player must act fast to shield her or pull her clear (**DX or ST check**).

This makes the encounter a **full party teamwork scene**, not just “Biele casts and wins.”

---

### Outcome

- The *Sojourner* painfully lurches back into motion.  
- The unnatural stillness lifts, but leaves an eerie, oppressive feeling behind.  
- The crew whispers about omens and cursed waters.  
- Biele knows, with absolute certainty, that **someone or something opposed her spell**.  
- Nyxie remains hidden for hours afterward.  
- Ohaku stays pressed close to Morgan, tail tucked.

> *“You moved the ship… but it feels as if something let you go only because it wanted you to see what’s ahead.”*

---

### Scene End

The ship resumes her cautious progress.  
Within a short time, a thin line of smoke is spotted on the horizon (**Scene 4 begins**).

---

**[End of Scene 3a: The Dead Calm]**

---

## Scene 4: Smoke Signal

### Scene Purpose
After completing the first leg of their coastal survey, the players and crew of the *Sojourner* spot unexpected signs of another human presence.  
This scene serves as transition from the survey (Scene 3) into the Harrow storyline (Scene 5).  
It also subtly introduces evidence of a wrecked vessel, tying into Harrow’s later appearance.

---

### Setting: Midday on the Coastline

> The coastline unrolls ahead like a jagged ribbon of green and stone, the jungle clawing down to meet the restless sea. The waves slap hollow and slow against the hull, the sound carrying far in the strange, heavy stillness. There is no wind. The sails hang limp. Even the gulls are gone.
> 
> Then you see it.
> 
> A thin vertical line of grey, far off beyond a tangled bluff. Not a brushfire. Not mist. Too clean, too steady. Smoke—and recent. Deliberate.
> 
> For a moment the crew stands frozen at the rail, silent and watchful. There has been no other sign of humanity on this cursed island. No other ship. No other sail.
> 
> The smoke drifts higher, curling softly into the blank grey sky like a signal whispered to no one.
> 
> Someone is out there.

The *Sojourner* rounds a rocky headland under a heavy, flat sky.  
Clouds hang in thick folds above the jungle canopy, and an oppressive stillness settles over the crew.  
The jungle shoreline stretches ahead in sharp ridges and tangled mangroves.

Then someone calls out from aloft:
> *“Smoke off the port bow! Just above the treeline!”*

A thin grey column rises steadily from inland, impossible to mistake for natural mist or firefly haze.

**GM prompt:**  
If Biele is active or on watch, allow her to pre-empt this with a Danger Sense or Weather Sense roll (or simply narrate it as a subtle “wrongness” in the air):
> *“Biele feels the weight of the wind shift just before the call—there’s fire ahead, controlled and deliberate.”*

---

### Investigation Choices

The players must decide:
- Sail closer and send a boat party ashore?  
- Ignore the signal and continue mapping? (Highly unlikely, but allow the choice.)  

If they approach:
The smoke column originates from a **small, neat campsite** set up just back from the shoreline, along a narrow beach beneath towering cliffs.  
The beach itself seems unusually well chosen: smooth landing, easy concealment, natural windbreak.

There are no signs of recent combat or active danger.

---

### Shore Description

> The longboat scrapes lightly onto the pebbled shore. Beyond the high-tide line, the wreckage of a small vessel lies scattered and broken like the bones of some ancient sea creature. Splintered timbers, warped ribs, and sun-bleached planks form a rough scar along the beach.
> 
> Nestled just beyond, where tangled undergrowth gives grudging space, stands a camp — orderly yet makeshift, the work of a practiced hand against impossible odds.
> 
> Two sturdy driftwood uprights frame a lean-to of canvas and sailcloth, stretched taut against wind and rain. Coiled ropes are hung neatly. A small pile of salvaged wood sits beside a carefully banked firepit, its faint smoke curling toward the grey sky.
> 
> Nothing is wasted. Fragments of hull have been lashed together to form a windbreak. Stripped lines serve as makeshift clotheslines and rigging. Every knot, every line, every plank bears the signature of someone who knows ships as extensions of themselves.
> 
> There is no sign of the sailor. Only the quiet crackle of the fire and the low hiss of waves beyond the wreck.

As the longboat approaches, the players can make Perception rolls to spot:
- A small lean-to made of canvas and sailcloth scraps, lashed between two driftwood uprights.  
- Broken timbers, shattered spars, and planking along the high tide line: clear evidence of a small wrecked vessel.  
- Reused planks and hull fragments built into the camp’s structure.  
- Fishing lines strung neatly between driftwood stakes.  
- An old-fashioned canvas sea bag resting near a rock.  
- A length of faded signal flag cord tied high between two saplings.

No person is visible. The camp looks freshly used.

> *“There is something strangely orderly about the camp. Not survivalist desperation, but professional seamanship. Everything secured. No mess. A mariner's hand, no question.”*

If players check the fire:
- They find freshly burned driftwood. The camp cannot have been abandoned long.  
- A single polished copper whistle hangs from a hook near the firepit (left deliberately).  
(Players may or may not take it; it serves no mechanical purpose but could be a personal item for RP.)

---

### Clues & Foreshadowing

This is a deliberate lead-in to Lucien Harrow:
- The wreckage and camp together strongly imply a small sloop or exploratory craft came ashore here.  
- Footprints (if tracked) lead inland toward the jungle.  
- A battered but intact **small wooden chest** (nautical design) is lashed with rope under the lean-to.  
- On the chest lid, faint initials carved long ago: **L.H.**  
(Players may or may not recognise this; it is not forced.)

If the players linger:
- A faint voice calling from deeper in the trees (Scene 5 trigger).  
- Alternatively: no encounter yet, the party returns to the *Sojourner* and Harrow appears later.

---

### Scene Conclusion

This scene ends with:
- Players realising there is another skilled seaman on the island.  
- Optional suspense if they choose to wait/camp near the site.  
- Direct lead-in to **Scene 5: Meeting Sir Lucien Harrow**.

> *“The steady column of smoke still curls lazily skyward. The forest remains silent. Whoever made this camp knows how to vanish—and yet, they left signs to be found.”*

---

**[End of Scene 4: Smoke Signal]**

---

## Scene 5: Meeting Captain Sir Lucien Harrow

### Scene Purpose
The players finally encounter the mysterious survivor.  
This scene introduces Harrow as a major recurring NPC and reveals the temporal paradox that deepens the central mystery of *Tomorrow’s Tide* and Kyngesreach itself.

This scene occurs after Scene 4 (Harrow’s camp).

---

### Setting: Inland Jungle Edge

Following the clear track from the wreckage and campsite, the players push into tangled, humid jungle.  
The undergrowth is thick, twisted vines and broad fronds pressing close. The path climbs slowly uphill.  
The oppressive stillness from the Dead Calm lingers slightly in the air.

> The trail leads through damp loam and under arching roots. It feels oddly deliberate—as though someone made no attempt to hide their passing, yet somehow you still feel watched.

---

### Narration Box: First Sight of Harrow

> The jungle track opens abruptly onto a narrow rise.  
> 
> A figure stands alone at the treeline, framed by the tangled green and looming against the flat grey sky. Tall, straight-backed, immaculately composed, he holds the stance of a man long accustomed to command and even longer accustomed to waiting.
> 
> His coat is deep navy, cut in an antique style not worn in generations, with worn gilded trim catching what little light filters through the canopy. His boots are polished but scarred. A sabre hilt rests casually at his side. The wide-brimmed hat tucked under one arm seems both ceremonial and practical.
> 
> Most striking of all, he holds a firearm trained unerringly upon you. It is unmistakably a matchlock—an archaic and ponderous design by modern standards—but this one is a masterpiece: flawlessly maintained, gleaming wood and metal, the brass inlays and hand-carved stock far finer than any battlefield weapon.
> 
> His voice cuts across the clearing, calm and sharp as the crack of canvas in a rising wind.  
> 
> *“You will kindly stop where you are. Identify yourselves.”*

---

### Encounter Setup

The man’s bearing is unshakably calm, voice clipped and precise.  
There is no panic. No desperation. Just cold naval discipline.

This is **Captain Sir Lucien Harrow**.

---

### Harrow’s Initial Dialogue

Sample options (adjust as needed for player behaviour):
- *“You are neither my crew… nor the relief party I expected. Explain yourselves.”*  
- *“This is not a safe place for wandering civilians. State your allegiance or stand aside.”*  
- *“You are not from the *Vigilant*. Then where in the Reach did you come from?”*

---

### Player Reactions & Paradox Realisation

Allow free roleplay. Players will likely:
- Introduce themselves  
- Ask about him  
- Realise his ship and uniform are impossibly old  
- Mention the *Sojourner* or their mapping expedition

Harrow introduces himself matter-of-factly:
> *“Captain Sir Lucien Harrow, Royal Explorer. My vessel, the *Hope’s Edge*, ran aground two days past. I have been awaiting rescue from the *HMS Vigilant*. You are not them.”*

At this moment, players **should instantly grasp the paradox**:
- Harrow is the same legendary explorer recorded as lost **250 years ago**.  
- His calm certainty that help would arrive from a ship long vanished into history drives home the inversion.

Encourage a quiet player reaction beat:
- Players may exchange looks.  
- Godfrey (if present) may quietly mutter: *“Oh hell...”*

Do not over-explain. Let them connect the dots.

---

### Harrow’s Reaction to Players

Once the tension eases, Harrow lowers the pistol.
He shifts from wary officer to pragmatic survivor:
> *“I see. So things are stranger than even I had feared. You appear genuine. I will trust that—for now.”*

If players mention modern gear:
- Harrow notices the flintlocks or fabrics.
- *“That’s… remarkably fine work. Curious indeed. We shall speak more of this later.”*

---

### Optional Additional Details

- Harrow shows no signs of madness or breakdown.  
- He asks sharply intelligent questions about tides, currents, star patterns (none of which match his expectations).  
- Players can ask about *Hope’s Edge* wreckage → Harrow calmly explains he stripped the remains for survival.  
- Harrow is too professional to speculate wildly about the time paradox. He focuses on immediate practicalities: survival, navigation, finding safe passage.

> *“Whatever… this is… we will face it as seamen. As we always have.”*

---

### Scene Conclusion

Harrow agrees to accompany the party back toward the shore:
> *“It seems fate has delivered me new companions. I will not waste the opportunity. Lead on.”*

The players have gained a new companion and a walking enigma:
> *“Captain Sir Lucien Harrow, Royal Explorer (Deceased).”*

Transition directly to next encounter (Jagular stalking scene).

---

**[End of Scene 5: Meeting Captain Sir Lucien Harrow]**
### Scene 4: Jagular Ambiguity
- Jagular pack stalks the players covertly, growling and rustling foliage without clear sightlines for ranged attacks.
- Players remain wary and ready for combat, frustrated by elusive targets.

### Scene 5: The Saltwatch Circle
**Location:** Windswept clifftop overlooking the open sea—exposed, lonely, atmospheric.

**Description:**
- Ring of rough-carved standing stones, mossy and salt-streaked.
- Symbols etched deeply: wave patterns, swirling stars, abstract storms and tides.
- Raised central stone dais with intricate motifs.
- Broken maritime offerings: ancient rope, driftwood, coral, sea-polished shells.

**Sensory Details:**
- Strong, briny winds whistle and moan.
- Salt spray stings eyes and skin; air tastes of the ocean.
- Echoes of crashing waves below add isolation and reverence.

**Purpose:**
- Ritual site related to weather, tides, navigation.
- Biele detects residual Stormcaller weather magic.
- Skill rolls (Occultism, Thaumatology, Weather Magic) reveal obfuscation spells preventing accurate navigation.

### Scene 6: Ambush of the Drowned (with revised Jagular notes)

**GM Running Guidance: Handling Jagular Allies (Revised Final)**

Step 1: Jagular Presence Without Visibility
- First describe low growls, rustling bushes, and glimpses of fur in the dense undergrowth. No clear line of fire. Players feel stalked but never see the full shape.

Step 2: Players’ Readiness as Part of the Drama
- Players likely ready weapons, nervously trying to sight targets. Let this tension sit for a beat or two, then escalate.

Step 3: Immediate Transition to Drowned Ambush
- At peak player frustration, trigger the ambush from the Drowned emerging from a different direction. Players must immediately divert attention and fight for survival.

Step 4: Jagular Intervention – Ambiguous Entry
- Mid-combat, thick brush explodes as the Jagulars finally reveal themselves.
- Describe a terrifying charge: powerful feline shapes, teeth and claws bared, leaping directly toward the melee. Players should believe the worst has happened.

Step 5: Dice Reveal the Truth
- As the first Jagular hits, narrate it bypassing or ignoring players completely to violently tackle the nearest Drowned.
- All Jagulars fight Drowned exclusively. They will even body-block between the players and their foes.
- Players will quickly understand the Jagulars are aiding them, not attacking.

Combat Notes:
- Slippery footing and dangerous cliff edges remain.
- Apply standard Drowned warrior and Jagular stat blocks.
- Maintain high narrative intensity throughout.

**Combat Details:**
- Slippery footing, cliff edges (fall risk), strong winds (DX -1 to ranged).
- Drowned Stat Block:
  - ST 12 DX 11 IQ 9 HT 12, HP 14 FP 12, DR 1+2 (natural/leather)
  - Rusted Cutlass (1d+2 cutting), Grapple, Doesn’t Breathe, High Pain Threshold.
- Jagular Stat Block:
  - ST 15 DX 14 IQ 4 HT 13, HP 17, DR 1
  - Claw (1d+2 cutting), Bite (1d+1 impaling), Enhanced Move, Night Vision, "Oh Bother" aura (Will-2 or -1 defence first round).

### Scene 7: Post-Combat Investigation
- Players find matching Stormcaller symbols on Drowned tattoos and Saltwatch stones.
- Biele detects deliberate interference woven into the site’s magic.
- First concrete evidence of Stormcaller activity.

### Scene 8: Harrow’s Historical Insight
- Harrow recognises the symbols, visibly unsettled.
- Recounts legends of sea-mages called "Saltwatches" who aided lost mariners.
- Suggests internal corruption or schism within the Stormcallers.

### Scene 9: Departure and Reflection
- Players complete coastal mapping and return to the *Sojourner*.
- Harrow joins the crew, welcomed cautiously by Godfrey.
- Players left to wonder if they have also shifted in time.

## Rewards & Outcomes
- Players have mapped the island.
- Biele gains deep insight into the cause of navigation confusion.
- Players confirm the Stormcaller cult exists and is active.
- The Jagular hostility reversal enriches future interaction.
- Harrow becomes a major recurring NPC.
- Adventure ends with:
  - Concrete proof of Stormcaller existence.
  - Biele’s validation and ongoing challenge.
  - Campaign intrigue: Harrow’s history, Drowned attack, Jagular mystery.

## Optional Details

### Harrow’s Equipment
- Antique naval sextant, outdated maps.
- Carved matchlock pistol (ceremonial).
- Personal journal with historic notations.

### Environmental Hazards (Saltwatch)
- Severe wind gusts (DX or lose small items).
- Slippery footing, risk of falling.

### Roleplaying Opportunities
- Harrow reacts to modern gear with fascination.
- Godfrey expresses concern over paradox risk.
- Players may speculate about the Jagular behaviour.

### Additional Player Clues
- Saltwatch symbols match Drowned tattoos and earlier "Jagular" idol.

## GM Tips & Notes
- Don’t allow early Jagular combat: keep them elusive.
- Time Drowned attack for maximum tension.
- Reveal Jagulars as allies during combat via exclusive focus on Drowned.
- Reinforce sense of Stormcaller interference but leave many unanswered mysteries.
