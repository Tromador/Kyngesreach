# Tomorrow’s Tide - Kyngesreach Campaign Adventure Module

## Adventure Overview
The players circumnavigate the mysterious jungle island, mapping its coastline. They encounter legendary explorer Captain Sir Lucien Harrow, stranded from his perspective only recently—though he vanished over 250 years ago. Investigating a Stormcaller ritual site guarded by hostile Drowned warriors reveals valuable clues about the mysterious Stormcaller cult. Meanwhile, the formerly hostile Jagulars unexpectedly intervene to assist the players.

## Scene 1 - Adventure Introduction

**Opening Scene: Quarterdeck, the morning of the island circumnavigation**

> **Captain Elias Godfrey (on the quarterdeck, calm and clear):**
> 
> “We’re not leaving. That much we’ve learned.
> 
> So we do what sailors do when they can't go forward. We go around.
> 
> This island—we don’t know its name. The maps don’t hold it. The stars above it turn sideways, and the compass spins like a drunk with a grudge. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be charted.
> 
> What we can see, we record. What we can’t, we mark by its absence. That’s how you make sense of something that doesn’t want to be known.
> 
> The jungle's already taken a swing at us. So has the sea. We’re still here.
> 
> From here on, it’s coastal runs and sounding lines. We hug the shoreline, we log every inlet, and we don’t assume the rocks today will be the same shape tomorrow.
> 
> If your head aches when you look at the stars—note it. If the sky tells you three things and none of them agree—write down all three. Patterns show up where facts refuse to.
> 
> And listen to Biele. If she says something’s wrong with the air, treat it like the rigging’s groaning before a blow.
> 
> This island wants to be forgotten. That’s why we remember. That’s why we draw every line twice.
> 
> We’re not lost. Not yet. And I don’t plan on learning how to be.
> 
> Let’s get to it.”

## Adventure Scenes

## Scene 2: Return to the Summer Bay Village

### Scene Purpose
The players previously expressed intent (AAR) to revisit the descendants of the *Summer Bay* crew to ask about the island before beginning their circumnavigation.  
This scene occurs **immediately after Godfrey’s briefing** and before the coastal survey expedition.

---

### Setting: The Jungle Trail to the Village

The players depart from the *Sojourner’s* beach camp.  
The humid jungle seems thicker than before. Mist hangs in heavy curtains. The chirr of insects fills the oppressive silence.  
Crew members accompanying the party clear the worst of the undergrowth with machetes.

> *The ground softens underfoot as they reach familiar territory. Dripping leaves brush damp trails across clothing. Somewhere nearby, something unseen crashes noisily through the undergrowth—then falls silent again.*

No encounters unless the GM chooses to insert them.

---

### Arrival at the Village

The clearing opens before them; simple raised huts, smoke from cookfires twisting in the still air, faded scraps of cloth fluttering weakly from ropes.  
The villagers are already watching, standing silent, cautious but not hostile.  
Children whisper and point from behind shelters. The adults wait for the players to speak first.

---

### Roleplay Interaction: Key NPC Dialogue

#### Kaptar (village chief)
> *“You return again. The sea has not taken you. Why do you seek us now?”*

#### Surgan (elder woman, healer)
> *“You wish to map the island? Brave. Or foolish. The land here does not stay where it belongs.”*  
> *“The Saltwatch once held the shores fast. They are gone. The stones remain. The winds whisper there still.”*

#### Fursmat (young warrior)
Says nothing at first; stands at the rear with wary eyes on the group.

---

### Player Enquiries

The villagers offer warnings, not guidance:
- “The island moves.”
- “Shorelines vanish.”
- “Reefs appear where none were.”
- “Currents run backwards under the full moon.”
- “The jagulars watch. They are not to be disturbed.”

If players ask about the “Saltwatch”:
> *“A place of standing stones. On the far side of the island. We do not go there.”*

(This is a foreshadow for **Scene 7: The Saltwatch Circle**.)

---

### Optional RP Outcome

As a sign of respect, the Kaptar presents the players with a small carved driftwood token:
- Shaped like a stylised wheel or compass rose.  
- Purely narrative; no mechanical bonus.

> *“Carry this. It remembers those who came before. Memory sometimes guides better than stars.”*

Players may attach it to the *Sojourner*’s wheel or keep it as a personal keepsake.

---

### Scene End & Transition

The players return to the *Sojourner* beach camp at any time.  
The crew makes final preparations for coastal mapping.  
This leads directly to **Scene 3: Charting the Coastline**.

> *As they step from the oppressive heat of the jungle back to the sea breeze, Nyxie pads out from under a boat and stares at them expectantly.*

---

**[End of Scene 2: Return to the Summer Bay Village]**

### Scene 3: Charting the Coastline

### Scene Purpose
The *Sojourner* begins its slow voyage around the perimeter of the island.  
Players are tasked with documenting landmarks, sketching charts, and attempting to produce the first true map of this shifting coastline.

---

### Setting: Aboard the *Sojourner*

> The sails creak faintly overhead, sagging in strange listless air. The jungle looms close to port and starboard both, a dark tangled wall that seems to lean over the sea like a living thing. The sun hangs low and sullen behind smears of high cloud; what little light filters down feels pale and uncertain.
> 
> As the *Sojourner* eases forward, the water itself seems to resist. Waves pull at the hull from unexpected angles. The compass spins once, twice, then settles pointing somewhere between north and nowhere at all.
> 
> Far overhead, seabirds wheel in tight, nervous circles. The faint slap of water against the hull is the only constant sound.
> 
> Behind the players, the anchor lies useless on the deck. There is no point in lowering it. Even if they stopped now, there is no guarantee they would find the same coastline when they raised it again.
> 
> The survey begins.

The early morning air is thick and heavy. A false calm hangs over the water as the ship pulls away from its temporary anchorage.

The jungle presses down to the water’s edge, tangled and oppressive.  
Grey-green waves lap listlessly against rock and sand.  
Distant cries of unseen birds echo under a heavy sky.  
The sea feels... wrong. Something about its texture and movement is subtly off.

> *“The water here runs sluggish yet restless. Ropes drag oddly when hauled. The sails behave as if confused, billowing against no discernible breeze.”*

Crew morale is tense but determined.

**Optional GM flavour (at player request):**
- The wake of the *Sojourner* twists and braids unnaturally behind her.  
- Compass needles spin, stop, and spin again.  
- Occasional wisps of mist rise suddenly from the water then vanish.  
- The shoreline itself seems subtly inconsistent: beaches lengthen, cliffs shift angles, forest edges advance or retreat.  

---

### Player Activity: The Survey

Players must decide:
- Who takes responsibility for navigation and plotting.  
- How to divide tasks (e.g. Biele plotting, others using sounding lines, lookout duty).

This scene is designed for **problem-solving and teamwork**.

#### Skill Rolls
Primary skills:  
- **Navigation (Sea)**  
- **Cartography**  
- **Seamanship**  
- **Perception**  

Supporting skills:
- **Astronomy**  
- **Mathematics (Surveying)**  
- **Weather Sense** (can warn of approaching distortion pockets)

**GM Note:**  
Success = players manage to produce rough but usable coastal sketches.  
Failure = charts become wildly contradictory, players must backtrack, or even risk grounding on unexpected reefs.

---

### Subtle Anomaly Event (Narrative)

Regardless of rolls, one major phenomenon occurs:
- Players realise features they passed earlier (such as a distinctive rock formation or inlet) are **gone when viewed again an hour later**, or **appear twice** where there should only be one.

**GM example lines:**
> *“The bay entrance you just sketched... no longer exists. It is a sheer cliff now.”*  
> *“The reef dead ahead is identical to one you passed already this morning—but your log shows you should be miles away.”*  
> *“Biele stares at the stars in frustration: none match the charts, or even each other.”*

This is the **first hard experience of the “shifting island” effect** (hidden Stormcaller disruption; players remain unaware of the cause).

---

### Highlight: Biele’s Abilities

Players will quickly discover that Biele’s unique sensitivity and mapping skill stabilises the data:
- If Biele makes a successful **Cartography or Navigation roll**, the ship avoids doubling back or becoming trapped in false loops.  
- If she fails, the ship may spend extra hours sailing in circles.

> *“Captain Godfrey watches grimly as Biele frowns at her charts, muttering under her breath and repeatedly redrawing the same jagged coastline segment with growing irritation.”*

This strongly reinforces Biele as the crew’s best (and perhaps only) guide in these waters.

---

### Optional Player Dialogue Prompts

Encourage players to engage:
- “Do you trust Biele’s instincts or double-check her work?”  
- “Do you want to sail closer inshore for better landmarks, or stay offshore for safety?”  
- “Do you try to record the impossible changes... or only what seems to stay put?”

There is no right answer; this builds player immersion.

---

### Scene Conclusion

After several exhausting hours the players manage to piece together a rough but unstable perimeter outline.

The coastline mapped so far:
- Feels untrustworthy.  
- May not match reality tomorrow.  
- But it’s the only chart they have.

> *“The last rays of sun filter weakly through leaden clouds. The crew ties off the last sounding line with relief, yet cannot shake the sensation that the ship has sailed through a place that was watching them all along.”*

Transition to next scene:
- Players spot a thin vertical plume of smoke rising faintly from a distant beach (leads to **Scene 4: Smoke Signal**).

---

### GM Sidebar: Spotlight on Biele – Scene 3

> **Use this encounter to gently bring Biele’s player forward.**  
> The player has sometimes remained in the background in past sessions; this is an ideal low-risk, high-importance spotlight moment.

Biele’s character build is uniquely suited to this scene:
- **Cartography 14** → best mapmaker aboard.  
- **Navigation (Sea) 14** → most skilled navigator.  
- **Weather Sense 14** → likely the first to sense atmospheric anomalies.  
- **Danger Sense (Advantage)** → perfect trigger for pre-warning of any unexplained spatial shifts.

Encourage Biele’s player by:
- Asking directly for her decisions: *“Biele, are you steering by the stars or the coastline?”*  
- Letting her make **exclusive rolls** to stabilise charts or avoid false landmarks.  
- Having NPCs (even Godfrey) defer to her judgment reluctantly:  
    > *“I don’t like trusting to magic, but... what does Biele say?”*

This is her first real test as the crew’s navigator in truly unnatural waters.  
A successful showing here naturally sets the tone for Biele’s central role throughout *Tomorrow’s Tide*.

> **GM Tip:**  
> Even on a failure, frame her as having made the best call under impossible conditions: *“The island moved after you mapped it. You were right; the sea itself cheated.”*

---

**[End of Scene 3: Charting the Coastline]**

## Scene 3a: The Dead Calm

### Scene Purpose
Provide a tense, atmospheric encounter that both gives Biele a magical spotlight moment and allows the rest of the party to actively contribute.  
The encounter also foreshadows that the players are being watched or interfered with by unseen forces, escalating the campaign mystery.

This scene occurs between Scene 3 (charting the coastline) and Scene 4 (smoke signal).

---

### Setting: Midday, Offshore

The *Sojourner* glides smoothly through calm seas under a leaden grey sky.  
The jungle ridge is a dark smudge on the horizon. The sails snap once—and fall utterly limp.  
The wind dies completely.  

The water goes mirror-still.  
An oppressive silence descends.

---

### Narration Box: The Sea Holds Its Breath

> Without warning, the wind dies. Not fades. Dies. The sails sag like collapsed lungs.  
> 
> The wake behind the ship fades instantly to nothing. The surface of the water becomes glassy and motionless.  
> 
> No bird calls. No distant waves. Even the rigging stops creaking. The air itself feels thick and heavy, as though the entire ocean is holding its breath.  
> 
> Then, below deck, Ohaku the dog begins to whine. A long, low sound that rises into an uneasy, mournful howl.  
> 
> A heartbeat later, Nyxie hisses violently, tail puffing out like a bottlebrush. She bolts under a coil of rope, vanishing into shadow.  
> 
> Biele freezes mid-step as a violent, overwhelming sense of wrongness washes over her like ice water. Every instinct screams that something is terribly, impossibly wrong.  
> 
> The crew mutter nervously. Several cross themselves or tap the mast.  
> 
> Something is here.

---

### Event Sequence

**1. Crew panic and indecision**
- Godfrey stays calm, but crew and players feel growing unease.
- No stars, no breeze, no sound.  
- The ship drifts motionless.

**2. Biele acts**
- Biele declares she will cast **Favourable Wind**.
- The spell works—but it feels *wrong*. As soon as she channels magic, she feels a hostile force pushing back.
- The air crackles faintly, static arcs across rigging.  
- Biele grits her teeth and *forces* the wind through sheer willpower, succeeding but at **double fatigue cost**.

**GM Description:**  
> *“The sails tremble, lurch, fall still… then with a snap they fill with ragged, choppy gusts. The ship begins to move, but sluggishly, as if some vast invisible hand reluctantly let go.”*

---

### Complication Events (Party Involvement)

While Biele casts:
- The ship becomes unstable, lines whip free, chaos erupts:
    - A **rope suddenly snaps** → any player can grab and secure it (**DX or Seamanship roll**).  
    - A sudden **lightning strike hits the mainsail** → small fire starts on rigging. Players must react fast (**DX, Seamanship, or improvised teamwork**).  
        - *As the afterimage burns into your vision, you swear—just for an instant—you saw the twisted arc trace an impossible shape, something jagged yet disturbingly symmetrical, like a sigil or glyph… and then it’s gone.*  
    - A heavy **spar swings loose toward Biele**, threatening to crush or sweep her overboard. Another player must act fast to shield her or pull her clear (**DX or ST check**).

This makes the encounter a **full party teamwork scene**, not just “Biele casts and wins.”

---

### Outcome

- The *Sojourner* painfully lurches back into motion.  
- The unnatural stillness lifts, but leaves an eerie, oppressive feeling behind.  
- The crew whispers about omens and cursed waters.  
- Biele knows, with absolute certainty, that **someone or something opposed her spell**.  
- Nyxie remains hidden for hours afterward.  
- Ohaku stays pressed close to Morgan, tail tucked.

> *“You moved the ship… but it feels as if something let you go only because it wanted you to see what’s ahead.”*

---

### Scene End

The ship resumes her cautious progress.  
Within a short time, a thin line of smoke is spotted on the horizon (**Scene 4 begins**).

---

**[End of Scene 3a: The Dead Calm]**

---

## Scene 4: Smoke Signal

### Scene Purpose
After completing the first leg of their coastal survey, the players and crew of the *Sojourner* spot unexpected signs of another human presence.  
This scene serves as transition from the survey (Scene 3) into the Harrow storyline (Scene 5).  
It also subtly introduces evidence of a wrecked vessel, tying into Harrow’s later appearance.

---

### Setting: Midday on the Coastline

> The coastline unrolls ahead like a jagged ribbon of green and stone, the jungle clawing down to meet the restless sea. The waves slap hollow and slow against the hull, the sound carrying far in the strange, heavy stillness. There is no wind. The sails hang limp. Even the gulls are gone.
> 
> Then you see it.
> 
> A thin vertical line of grey, far off beyond a tangled bluff. Not a brushfire. Not mist. Too clean, too steady. Smoke—and recent. Deliberate.
> 
> For a moment the crew stands frozen at the rail, silent and watchful. There has been no other sign of humanity on this cursed island. No other ship. No other sail.
> 
> The smoke drifts higher, curling softly into the blank grey sky like a signal whispered to no one.
> 
> Someone is out there.

The *Sojourner* rounds a rocky headland under a heavy, flat sky.  
Clouds hang in thick folds above the jungle canopy, and an oppressive stillness settles over the crew.  
The jungle shoreline stretches ahead in sharp ridges and tangled mangroves.

Then someone calls out from aloft:
> *“Smoke off the port bow! Just above the treeline!”*

A thin grey column rises steadily from inland, impossible to mistake for natural mist or firefly haze.

**GM prompt:**  
If Biele is active or on watch, allow her to pre-empt this with a Danger Sense or Weather Sense roll (or simply narrate it as a subtle “wrongness” in the air):
> *“Biele feels the weight of the wind shift just before the call—there’s fire ahead, controlled and deliberate.”*

---

### Investigation Choices

The players must decide:
- Sail closer and send a boat party ashore?  
- Ignore the signal and continue mapping? (Highly unlikely, but allow the choice.)  

If they approach:
The smoke column originates from a **small, neat campsite** set up just back from the shoreline, along a narrow beach beneath towering cliffs.  
The beach itself seems unusually well chosen: smooth landing, easy concealment, natural windbreak.

There are no signs of recent combat or active danger.

---

### Shore Description

> The longboat scrapes lightly onto the pebbled shore. Beyond the high-tide line, the wreckage of a small vessel lies scattered and broken like the bones of some ancient sea creature. Splintered timbers, warped ribs, and sun-bleached planks form a rough scar along the beach.
> 
> Nestled just beyond, where tangled undergrowth gives grudging space, stands a camp — orderly yet makeshift, the work of a practiced hand against impossible odds.
> 
> Two sturdy driftwood uprights frame a lean-to of canvas and sailcloth, stretched taut against wind and rain. Coiled ropes are hung neatly. A small pile of salvaged wood sits beside a carefully banked firepit, its faint smoke curling toward the grey sky.
> 
> Nothing is wasted. Fragments of hull have been lashed together to form a windbreak. Stripped lines serve as makeshift clotheslines and rigging. Every knot, every line, every plank bears the signature of someone who knows ships as extensions of themselves.
> 
> There is no sign of the sailor. Only the quiet crackle of the fire and the low hiss of waves beyond the wreck.

As the longboat approaches, the players can make Perception rolls to spot:
- A small lean-to made of canvas and sailcloth scraps, lashed between two driftwood uprights.  
- Broken timbers, shattered spars, and planking along the high tide line: clear evidence of a small wrecked vessel.  
- Reused planks and hull fragments built into the camp’s structure.  
- Fishing lines strung neatly between driftwood stakes.  
- An old-fashioned canvas sea bag resting near a rock.  
- A length of faded signal flag cord tied high between two saplings.

No person is visible. The camp looks freshly used.

> *“There is something strangely orderly about the camp. Not survivalist desperation, but professional seamanship. Everything secured. No mess. A mariner's hand, no question.”*

If players check the fire:
- They find freshly burned driftwood. The camp cannot have been abandoned long.  
- A single polished copper whistle hangs from a hook near the firepit (left deliberately).  
(Players may or may not take it; it serves no mechanical purpose but could be a personal item for RP.)

---

### Clues & Foreshadowing

This is a deliberate lead-in to Lucien Harrow:
- The wreckage and camp together strongly imply a small sloop or exploratory craft came ashore here.  
- Footprints (if tracked) lead inland toward the jungle.  
- A battered but intact **small wooden chest** (nautical design) is lashed with rope under the lean-to.  
- On the chest lid, faint initials carved long ago: **L.H.**  
(Players may or may not recognise this; it is not forced.)

If the players linger:
- A faint voice calling from deeper in the trees (Scene 5 trigger).  
- Alternatively: no encounter yet, the party returns to the *Sojourner* and Harrow appears later.

---

### Scene Conclusion

This scene ends with:
- Players realising there is another skilled seaman on the island.  
- Optional suspense if they choose to wait/camp near the site.  
- Direct lead-in to **Scene 5: Meeting Sir Lucien Harrow**.

> *“The steady column of smoke still curls lazily skyward. The forest remains silent. Whoever made this camp knows how to vanish—and yet, they left signs to be found.”*

---

**[End of Scene 4: Smoke Signal]**

---
## Scene 5: Meeting Captain Sir Lucien Harrow

### Scene Purpose
The players finally encounter the mysterious survivor.  
This scene introduces Harrow as a major recurring NPC and reveals the temporal paradox that deepens the central mystery of *Tomorrow’s Tide* and Kyngesreach itself.  
It also provides player motivation to proceed inland rather than return to the *Sojourner* immediately.

---

### Setting: Inland Jungle Edge

Following the clear track from the wreckage and campsite, the players push into tangled, humid jungle.  
The undergrowth is thick, twisted vines and broad fronds pressing close. The path climbs slowly uphill.  
The oppressive stillness from the Dead Calm lingers slightly in the air.

> The trail leads through damp loam and under arching roots. It feels oddly deliberate—as though someone made no attempt to hide their passing, yet somehow you still feel watched.

---

### Narration Box: First Sight of Harrow

> The jungle track opens abruptly onto a narrow rise.  
> 
> A figure stands alone at the treeline, framed by the tangled green and looming against the flat grey sky. Tall, straight-backed, immaculately composed, he holds the stance of a man long accustomed to command and even longer accustomed to waiting.
> 
> His coat is deep navy, cut in an antique style not worn in generations, with worn gilded trim catching what little light filters through the canopy. His boots are polished but scarred. A sabre hilt rests casually at his side. The wide-brimmed hat tucked under one arm seems both ceremonial and practical.
> 
> Most striking of all, he holds a firearm trained unerringly upon you. It is unmistakably a matchlock—an archaic and ponderous design by modern standards—but this one is a masterpiece: flawlessly maintained, gleaming wood and metal, the brass inlays and hand-carved stock far finer than any battlefield weapon.
> 
> His voice cuts across the clearing, calm and sharp as the crack of canvas in a rising wind.  
> 
> *“You will kindly stop where you are. Identify yourselves.”*

---

### Encounter Setup

The man’s bearing is unshakably calm, voice clipped and precise.  
There is no panic. No desperation. Just cold naval discipline.

This is **Captain Sir Lucien Harrow**.

---

### Harrow’s Initial Dialogue

Sample options (adjust as needed for player behaviour):
- *“You are neither my crew… nor the relief party I expected. Explain yourselves.”*  
- *“This is not a safe place for wandering civilians. State your allegiance or stand aside.”*  
- *“You are not from the *Vigilant*. Then where in the Reach did you come from?”*

---

### Player Reactions & Paradox Realisation

Allow free roleplay. Players will likely:
- Introduce themselves  
- Ask about him  
- Realise his ship and uniform are impossibly old  
- Mention the *Sojourner* or their mapping expedition

Harrow introduces himself matter-of-factly:
> *“Captain Sir Lucien Harrow, Royal Explorer. My vessel, the *Hope’s Edge*, ran aground two days past. I have been awaiting rescue from the *HMS Vigilant*. You are not them.”*

At this moment, players **should instantly grasp the paradox**:
- Harrow is the same legendary explorer recorded as lost **250 years ago**.  
- His calm certainty that help would arrive from a ship long vanished into history drives home the inversion.

Encourage a quiet player reaction beat:
- Players may exchange looks.  
- Godfrey (if present) may quietly mutter: *“Oh hell...”*

Do not over-explain. Let them connect the dots.

---

### Harrow’s Reaction to Players

Once the tension eases, Harrow lowers the pistol.
He shifts from wary officer to pragmatic survivor:
> *“I see. So things are stranger than even I had feared. You appear genuine. I will trust that—for now.”*

If players mention modern gear:
- Harrow notices the flintlocks or fabrics.
- *“That’s… remarkably fine work. Curious indeed. We shall speak more of this later.”*

---

### Optional Additional Details

- Harrow shows no signs of madness or breakdown.  
- He asks sharply intelligent questions about tides, currents, star patterns (none of which match his expectations).  
- Players can ask about *Hope’s Edge* wreckage → Harrow calmly explains he stripped the remains for survival.  
- Harrow is too professional to speculate wildly about the time paradox. He focuses on immediate practicalities: survival, navigation, finding safe passage.

> *“Whatever… this is… we will face it as seamen. As we always have.”*

---

### Motivation to Proceed Inland (Player Hook)

Before returning to the coast, Harrow gestures up the ridge toward a distant rise.
> *“There’s something up there. Stone shapes, unnatural. I intended to investigate before you arrived. I think it may be important.”*

He hesitates briefly, unusual for his calm demeanour.
> *“Also… I’ve heard something stalking me these past two nights. Heavy footfalls. Low huffing. I thought I glimpsed orange fur once between the trees. I have no wish to meet whatever it is alone.”*

Biele frowns as the stars and compass shift again subtly.

Simultaneously, the players hear another distant, guttural growl from the trees.  
The crew grip their weapons warily.

**Optional Player Reasoning:**  
Players may also reason that the elusive stalking creatures (Jagulars) must have lairs near the cliffs.  
With Harrow’s goal and the chance of confronting a Jagular both ahead, it becomes the logical—and irresistible—next step.

---

### Scene Conclusion

Harrow agrees to accompany the party toward the cliffs:
> *“It seems fate has delivered me new companions. I will not waste the opportunity. Lead on.”*

The players have gained a new companion and a walking enigma:
> *“Captain Sir Lucien Harrow, Royal Explorer (Deceased).”*

Transition directly to next encounter (Jagular stalking scene).

---

**[End of Scene 5: Meeting Captain Sir Lucien Harrow]**

---
## Scene 6: Jagular Encounter – Unexpected Allies

### Scene Purpose
To build tension and uncertainty.  
The players and Harrow encounter the Jagulars for the first time in *Tomorrow’s Tide*.  
They appear as stalking, unseen presences—frightening but non-hostile.  
This scene sets up the dramatic payoff of the Jagulars as allies in Scene 7.

---

### Setting: Coastal Jungle Edge

The party is returning with Harrow toward the cliffs, moving cautiously along the overgrown jungle path paralleling the coastline.

The path narrows. Thick vines, strangler figs, and giant fronds force single-file travel.  
There is no breeze. The oppressive weight of the Dead Calm still lingers faintly.

---

### Narration Box: The Stalkers in the Shadows

> The jungle narrows around you into a choking corridor of green. Every step feels muffled.  
> 
> Then—movement. Just at the edge of vision. A flicker between two trees. The low snap of a branch under a heavy paw.  
> 
> Ohaku halts dead, ears flattened, tail tucked. He growls deep in his throat. His hackles rise. The party falls still.  
> 
> A low, rolling growl reverberates from somewhere just beyond sight. Another answers it further along the path.  
> 
> The sound is wrong. Too deep. Too heavy.  
> 
> Something is pacing you. More than one.  
> 
> No matter how quickly you spin, no target shows itself. The undergrowth shifts. Shapes blur into shadow and are gone.  
> 
> The sensation of being herded—or studied—crawls across your skin.

---

### Encounter Setup

The players cannot engage:
- There are **no clear targets**.  
- The Jagulars stay **perfectly concealed**.  
- Any shots or attacks will hit only tangled brush.  

**GM Guidance:**
- Let players take actions: draw weapons, aim, shout warnings.  
- Play out frustration: every attempt to locate or confront fails.  
- The goal is to build dread, not combat.

If players call out or cast light spells:
- Brief yellow eyes reflect once in the distance… then vanish.

Harrow remains calm but cautious:
> *“Hold your nerve. They’re there… but they’re not striking. That worries me more.”*

---

### Optional Player Decisions

Offer the players some tension:
- Do they proceed slowly, weapons up?  
- Do they attempt to retreat?  
- Do they suggest splitting up to cover more ground? (**Never recommend this, but let them propose it**)

No matter what, after several tense minutes:
- The sounds fade.  
- The unseen predators vanish back into the jungle.  
- The path ahead clears as if “permission” has been granted.

---

### Scene Conclusion

Leave the players deeply unsettled.  
No explanation. No evidence.  
They were watched—and let go.

> *“You feel the weight of unseen eyes lift from your backs. The jungle remains silent. Too silent.”*

The party continues onward toward the cliffs, setting up their next destination: the Saltwatch Circle (Scene 7).

---

**[End of Scene 6: Jagular Encounter – Unexpected Allies]**

## Scene 7: The Saltwatch Circle

### Scene Purpose
The players reach the ancient Stormcaller ritual site.  
This is both the emotional peak of *Tomorrow’s Tide* and the trigger point for the Drowned ambush.  
The scene should feel overwhelming, hostile, and untouchable.  
Players should leave shaken and full of questions, with no clear answers.

---

### Setting: The Cliff Path

The path narrows and climbs steeply.  
The trees fall away behind them, leaving only jagged rock and low wind-scrubbed grass.  
The wind sharpens as they ascend.  
The distant roar of surf echoes strangely upward from far below.

> The players crest the ridge, and the world opens before them like a wound. The sky is a low bruised slate. The sea below hammers relentlessly against black cliffs. There is no softness here. There never was.

---

### Narration Box: First Sight of the Circle

> As you crest the ridge a sudden violent gust of wind steals your breath and knifes through clothing.  
> 
> Dark clouds roll in, taking the sun from the sky and the warmth from your bodies as a peal of thunder echoes about the clifftop.  
> 
> You stagger into a bleak world of stone and sky.  
> 
> The circle stands alone atop the headland, stark and terrible against the heaving grey wall of ocean beyond.  
> 
> Great standing stones rise from the exposed turf like broken teeth. Their silhouettes stand stark and angular against the greying sky.  
> 
> The carved spirals and wave motifs gleam faintly under the bruised light. Salt spray stings your face. The distant crashing of waves below feels louder than it should—as though the sea itself is listening.  
> 
> There is no shelter, no cover. Only the primal forces of earth, sea, and sky, with a creeping sense of foreboding beneath a storm darkened sky.

---

### Weather Description (progressive)

- As players explore, **wind increases** to constant shriek.  
- **Cold rain begins** in scattered drops, then becomes driving sheets.  
- The sky darkens unnaturally fast.  
- The players feel exposed, watched, and entirely insignificant.

> The players cannot hear each other over the howl of the gale. There is no shelter. The circle offers no protection—only judgment.

---

### Player Exploration & Biele’s Moment

- Biele senses the place as **heavily tainted**.  
- A Stormcaller ritual site, ancient but corrupted.  
- Investigation (Occultism, Thaumatology, Weather Magic) reveals:  
    - Deliberate magical interference woven into the stones.  
    - Purpose: to confuse navigation, disrupt charts, break celestial tracking.  
    - Biele feels **the same hand that resisted her at sea** lingers here faintly.

> *“It’s not just the island shifting. They made it shift.”*

This is her final major spotlight in the adventure.

---

### The Drowned Ambush

As tension peaks:
- A lightning bolt strikes the sea far below.  
- The players barely react before **Drowned warriors erupt from hidden rocky gullies and shallow tide pools behind the cliffs**.  
- The storm reaches full fury:
    - Blinding rain  
    - Winds tearing at clothing  
    - The crash of waves now almost at their backs  

Combat begins in **the middle of a howling storm**.  
The stones loom overhead as silent witnesses.

---

### Combat Notes

- The storm remains purely atmospheric (unless you wish to apply minor DX penalties or footing checks).  
- The cliffs remain a dangerous backdrop:
    - Players or Drowned can be knocked toward the edge for added risk.  
    - Falling is death.  
- The Jagulars will not appear yet (Scene 8 = rescue moment).

---

### Scene Conclusion

The battle ends (or pauses at critical point) → directly into Scene 8 (Jagulars intervene).  
Leave players wind-lashed, soaked, breathing hard, surrounded by corpses—and more questions than answers.

---

## Scene 8: Ambush of the Drowned + Jagular Rescue

### Scene Purpose
The players face their first true combat at the Saltwatch Circle.  
This is designed to be a terrifying, overwhelming fight—until the Jagulars intervene unexpectedly, saving the party from possible defeat.  
It delivers the biggest surprise twist of the adventure.

---

### Opening Scene: Lightning Strike + Reveal

As the players finish exploring the Saltwatch Circle, the storm builds to full fury.  
The waves below hammer the cliffs. Wind tears at clothing and gear. The rain lashes harder with each heartbeat.

Suddenly—a blinding crack of lightning splits the sky.  
The world turns white for a single, frozen instant.

> **Narration:**
> 
> Silhouetted against the flash of light, they stand: ragged, hulking shapes dragging themselves over the rocky edge of the cliff and out from narrow gullies.
> 
> At first you think they are men. Then the light fades, and you see the truth.
> 
> Blackened, bloated flesh stretches over water-swollen limbs. Tattered rigging and seaweed hang like decayed banners from their frames. Ancient barnacles crust their joints and torsos.  
> 
> Their jaws gape open soundlessly. Empty, sunken sockets stare at nothing.  
> 
> They move with heavy, jerking motions as though they are still fighting invisible waves.
> 
> The Drowned have come.

---

### Combat Encounter: Players vs. The Drowned

The Drowned attack without hesitation, mindless and relentless.

**GM Guidance:**
- Start with 1 Drowned per player + 1 additional Drowned for Harrow.  
- **Scaling Guidance:** If the players are performing extremely well, feel free to add 2–3 additional Drowned warriors mid-combat to maintain tension and urgency.  
- If the players are struggling badly, allow the Jagulars to intervene early.  
- The storm is at full strength: sheeting rain, screaming wind, crashing waves nearby.  
- You may optionally apply DX -1 to all combatants for footing on slippery stone, at GM discretion.

---

---

### Combat Twist: Jagular Intervention

As the battle becomes desperate:
- Players begin to lose ground.  
- Then, out of nowhere, **Jagulars burst from the jungle at full charge**.

#### Step 1: Terrifying Entry
- First describe the shapes crashing through the undergrowth at speed.  
- Claws extended, teeth bared, powerful feline forms leaping directly toward the melee.

#### Step 2: Players Expect Worst
- Players should believe they are about to be overwhelmed by a second deadly wave.

> **GM Optional Ambush Deception:**  
> On arrival, describe the first Jagular leaping in next to (or directly at) a player as if to attack.  
> Allow the player to instinctively declare Dodge or Parry.  
> Resolve it as a non-action: the Jagular ignores the player entirely and instead slams into the nearest Drowned.  
> The player suffers no action loss.  
> This moment of deliberate misdirection maximises the dramatic reveal of the Jagulars as unexpected allies.

#### Step 3: The Reveal
- As the first Jagular reaches melee, it ignores the players completely and savagely tackles the nearest Drowned.  
- Subsequent Jagulars do the same—fighting exclusively against the Drowned.

#### Step 4: Combat Becomes 3-Sided Chaos
- The battle continues as players + Jagulars vs. Drowned.  
- The Jagulars do not interact with the players other than incidentally protecting them.  
- If a player stumbles near a Jagular, the beast simply brushes past, focusing entirely on the cultists.

---

### **Jagular Stat Block**

**Jagular (Island Apex Predator)**  
- ST 15  
- DX 14  
- IQ 4  
- HT 13

---

### Outcome

The battle ends with all Drowned destroyed (Jagulars will maul any survivors).

> **Narration:**
> 
> The last of the Drowned collapses into the wet grass with a final, shuddering spasm.  
> 
> For a moment, nothing moves.  
> 
> Then, as if the island itself has exhaled, the wind dies. The driving rain slackens to a fine mist.  
> 
> The thick clouds tear open overhead, letting pale shafts of sunlight stab down onto the broken circle of stones.  
> 
> A single rumble of thunder rolls across the sea like a departing warning.  
> 
> As the heat and humidity return, you glimpse the Jagulars one last time.  
> 
> A single powerful shape stands motionless at the treeline, golden eyes catching the weak light. It holds your gaze for a breathless instant… then turns and vanishes soundlessly into the dripping undergrowth.  
> 
> The others are already gone.  
> 
> The stone circle stands silent, indifferent, as if nothing had ever happened here at all.

---

### Scene Transition

Leave players stunned, confused, and completely unprepared for this development.  
They expected an attack.  
They received a rescue.  
The true nature of the Jagulars remains utterly unknown.

Transition directly to **Scene 9: Post-Combat Investigation & Harrow Recognition**.

---

**[End of Scene 8: Ambush of the Drowned + Jagular Rescue]**


## Scene 9: Post-Combat Investigation & Harrow Recognition

### Scene Purpose
This is the fallout scene after the Drowned battle.  
Players have time to breathe, explore, and finally get campaign-relevant clues—but no solid answers.  
Harrow provides the first indisputable link between the site, the Drowned, and the old tales of sea-mages.  
The Jagular mystery remains unanswered.

---

### Opening Scene: Calm After the Storm

The stone circle is still.  
The storm has passed.  
Steam curls upward from the wet ground.  
The cliffs still boom with distant surf.  
The players are exhausted, soaked, and alone again.

> **Narration:**
> 
> The circle lies empty under the returning heat.  
> 
> Broken shells, weathered rope, driftwood fragments, and sea-polished bones litter the muddy grass.  
> 
> The bodies of the Drowned lie crumpled where they fell.  
> 
> Only the echoes of the battle remain.

---

### Player Actions: Searching the Site

Allow free investigation:
- Players may examine the Drowned bodies:  
    - Each bears crude wave/star tattoos burned or carved into dead flesh.  
    - Symbols match motifs carved into the stones.  
- If the players previously examined Enzo or Matteo (Varenza adventure), they immediately recognise the tattoos.  
    - The crude spiral and wave designs burned into the Drowned match exactly.  
    - This is the first clear confirmation that both encounters are linked to the same unknown cult.  
- The stones themselves are heavily weathered, but distinct spiral and wave patterns remain.  
- Biele can sense lingering traces of ritual weather magic:
    - Twisted, corrupted, no longer functioning as intended.  
    - Residual energy feels **similar to the interference she fought at sea**.

> Biele (quietly): *“They did this. They made the island change.”*

---

### Harrow’s Recognition: The Sea-Mage Connection

As players piece clues together, Harrow frowns deeply and touches one of the carvings.

> Harrow (quietly, frowning as he studies the markings):  
> “I’ve seen magic. Any sailor with years at sea has.
>
> But this…
> 
> There were old tales, whispered by the oldest hands.
> 
> Of a group—sea-mages, they were called—who withdrew into the Reach, far from shipping lanes.
> Not feared. Not cursed.
> 
> Said to guide lost ships to safety… to still storms when the rites were honoured
> They were spoken of with reverence. Quiet respect.
> 
> I always thought it just the usual dockside yarns.
> 
> But these carvings… these marks burned into the dead…
>
> They match the stories.
> 
> I remember.
> It’s them. There can be no doubt.”

Harrow does not know their true name, purpose, or why they have become corrupted.  
He offers no further answers.  
The players are left with the first hard fact of the campaign: the Drowned are descended from the sea-mages of old legend.

---

### Optional Player Dialogue

Encourage players to discuss:
- How could such a benevolent group produce horrors like the Drowned?  
- Was there a schism, corruption, or betrayal?  
- Is someone or something twisting the old power for darker ends?  
- Was Harrow simply wrong, or did something go terribly wrong?

**Do not answer any of it.**  
This scene exists purely to deliver the campaign’s first undeniable lore connection.

---

### Scene Conclusion

When ready, players gather themselves and descend back toward the coast:
> The sun burns down. The island returns to crushing, indifferent stillness. The *Sojourner* waits below.

Transition to **Scene 10: Return to the Sojourner & Adventure Wrap-up**.

---

**[End of Scene 9: Post-Combat Investigation & Harrow Recognition]**

## Scene 10: Return to the Sojourner & Adventure Wrap-up

### Scene Purpose
The players return from the Saltwatch Circle to the relative safety of the *Sojourner*.  
This is a quiet, reflective closing scene.  
The players have survived—but nothing feels resolved.  
This is the true “end of first act” moment for the campaign.

---

### Setting: The Descent from the Cliffs

The players pick their way back down the ridge in heavy, wet silence.  
The jungle heat returns full force, clinging and oppressive.  
Boots squelch in the mud.  
The sounds of birds and insects slowly creep back into the still air.  
There is no sign of the Jagulars.

> **Narration:**
> 
> The jungle swallows the cliffs behind you.  
> 
> The island gives no farewell.  
> 
> Only the ceaseless thrum of unseen creatures in the brush, the buzzing of insects, and the wet slap of boots in the mud remain.

---

### Arrival at the *Sojourner*

The familiar shape of the *Sojourner* waits anchored off the beach, crew anxiously scanning the treeline.  
A boat is dispatched immediately when the party appears.

On deck:
- Captain Godfrey meets them in person.  
- Harrow steps aboard slowly, eyeing the modern fittings and weaponry with quiet fascination.  
- Godfrey greets Harrow stiffly but politely.

> Godfrey (curt nod):  
> “Captain Sir Lucien Harrow. I know your name. It’s in every lost ship registry going back two centuries.”  
> 
> (Pauses, glances at the crew)  
> 
> “We’ll sort out what that means later. For now, welcome aboard.”

Harrow simply inclines his head:
> “Gratefully accepted.”

---

### Player Dialogue Opportunity

Allow players to report what they found:  
- Describe the Drowned.  
- Mention the stone site and Biele’s magic reading.  
- Share Harrow’s recognition of the symbols (optional).  
- Express growing unease about what else might be out there.

Godfrey listens grimly:
> “I’ve no taste for ghosts or cults. But we came here for answers, and I don’t intend to leave without them.”

Godfrey then nods to Biele:
> “Whatever curse this place held, your charts defied it. That’s our way forward.”  
> 
> He turns to the crew:  
> “Mark it well. We sail at first light.”

---

### Closing Mood

As the players settle back into ship routines:
> The sun sets hard and fast over the jungle skyline.  
> 
> Long shadows creep out across the still water.  
> 
> The island waits, silent and unreadable, as the night closes in once more.

The adventure ends here.

The players have achieved:
- Survival  
- A rough coastal map (still unreliable)  
- Their first real clue to the Stormcaller Cult  
- A major NPC ally in Harrow  
- More questions than answers

---

### GM Notes: Optional Hook

If desired, as a final tag:
> That night, Biele dreams of wave patterns and storm symbols shifting impossibly across maps she cannot read.  
> The compass by her bunk spins slowly in the dark.  
> Fade to black.
