## SCENE FLOW

### BEAT 1: Setup – "Rope Drill"

**Prompt**:  
> *“It’s your third day at sea. The Sojourner rides the wind steady, sails full. A good day—at least on paper. But for you? It’s rope drill.”*

Boatswain Kincaid is running a **training exercise for officers and specialists**—including the players—to teach basic rigging skills. Her philosophy:  
> *“If it keeps you above the waterline, you bloody well ought to know how to do it.”*

**NPC Roles**:
- **Lt. Drake** – Acting as a confident instructor, energetic but casual.
- **Iron Meg** – On deck, pacing like a predator. Whistle in hand.

**Player Involvement**:  
Ask each PC: *Where are you during the drill?*  
Options:
- Hands-on with ropes
- Overseeing lines
- Up in the rigging
- Watching from the deck
- Trying to disappear

---

### BEAT 2: Trouble Brews

**Trigger**:  
Pick a PC randomly or roll Perception / Seamanship.

> *“One line catches your eye—too pale, too dry. It doesn’t look right. The wind pulls it tight, and something in your gut says it’s wrong. You have seconds.”*

**Choices**:
- Shout a warning (Leadership, Fast-Talk, CHA)
- Climb to intervene (DX or Acrobatics – difficult)
- Try to brace or haul the rope (ST or Rope Use)
- Freeze and see it snap

> **Note**: Even on success, the rope will still break—the players can reduce harm, not prevent it.

---

### BEAT 3: SNAP AND CHAOS

**Event**:
- Rope parts with a loud **CRACK**
- Sail flaps free, snapping taut
- One junior sailor thrown into the gunwale—badly injured
- Deck erupts into shouting and confusion

**Player Reactions**:

| Action                   | Skill                   | Outcome                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Secure flapping sail     | Rope Use, DX             | Prevents further sail damage     |
| Haul injured crewman     | ST, DX                   | Prevents worsening the injury     |
| Bark orders at panicking crew | Leadership         | Restores partial order           |
| Climb to brace rigging   | Acrobatics, Seamanship   | Secures upper rigging             |
| Creative problem-solving | Seamanship or IQ         | Novel fix, improvisation          |
| Do nothing / fail roll   | —                        | Adds chaos or leads to comic result |

---

### COMEDY MOMENT: The Dangling Disaster

If a PC fails a roll (or just for flavour):

- A PC (or crewman) ends up **dangling upside down**, about three feet off the deck
- Rope wrapped around their ankle, spinning slowly
- One boot has fallen off

**Iron Meg (deadpan)**:  
> *“Comfortable, are we?”*  
> *“Anyone else fancy learning your knots the hard way?”*

(Line might unspool just afterward, dropping the victim unceremoniously.)

---

### BEAT 4: Aftermath – The Dust Settles

**Injuries**:
- One sailor down with a compound leg break
- Sail slightly damaged
- Temporary rigging loss, now being repaired

**NPC Reactions**:
- **Iron Meg** (to all):  
  > *“That’s why we practice now. Not when the sky’s black and the sea’s trying to eat us.”*

  Then, to crew dragging the wounded:  
  > *“Haul him below. If he can scream, he can breathe.”*

- **Lt. Drake**:  
  - If PCs acted well:  
    > *“Good eyes. You might just have a sailor’s spine under there.”*
  - If PCs froze or hesitated:  
    > *“Next time, move first. We don’t always get second ones.”*

**Optional Player Investigation**:
- Rope can be examined later
- Seamanship / Ropecraft reveals dry rot or poor treatment
- Could be tied to bad port supplies or just neglected inventory

---

### BEAT 5: Transition Forward

- Crew tension rising
- Whispered rumours begin (“Bad luck this early...”)
- Nyxie spotted walking the spar, tail twitching

---

### PLAYER NOTE: Morgan’s Seamanship

Morgan has **notably high Seamanship**. This is an ideal moment for him to:
- Spot the rope flaw before the break
- Take control of part of the crisis
- Earn praise from Meg or Drake

Prompt if needed:
> *“Morgan—you’ve seen lines like this fail before. What do you do?”*
