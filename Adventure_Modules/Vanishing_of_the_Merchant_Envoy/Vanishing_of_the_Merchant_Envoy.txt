# **Adventure Module: The Vanishing of the Merchant Envoy**
## **Scene: Captain Godfrey's Cabin**

The heavy oak door creaks shut behind the players as they step into Captain Elias Godfrey's cabin. The room is spacious by shipboard standards, its walls lined with maps—many of which end in blank spaces beyond the known coastlines—and shelves of navigational instruments. A single lantern swings overhead, casting flickering light over the cluttered desk where papers, sealed letters, and half-finished reports lie in disarray. The air carries the familiar scents of salt, aged wood, and faint tobacco smoke.

Captain Godfrey stands at the far side of the cabin, his uniform neat despite the tension etched into his weathered face. His gray eyes shift between the players as he leans forward, both hands planted on the tabletop. Behind him, a small window frames the dark silhouette of the port, illuminated by scattered lanterns and the distant glow of dockside taverns. Outside, the soft creak of the hull and faint murmurs from the crew echo the unease hanging over the ship.

Godfrey clears his throat, his voice a gravelly baritone shaped by decades at sea and sharpened by authority.

> **Captain Godfrey's Speech:**  
> "No point dressing this up—we've got a problem on our hands. The merchant envoy—the man who funded this entire venture—has gone missing. Vanished days before we’re set to depart. And don’t think for a second the crew hasn’t noticed. Half of them are already whispering about curses and ill omens. Hell, with the waters we’re sailing into, I can’t entirely blame them. Most folk with sense steer clear of that stretch of sea. It’s uncharted, it’s dangerous, and ships that head out there… well, they’re not known for coming back. And yet here we are."
>
> *He pauses, glancing at the maps before returning his gaze to the players.*  
> "We’ve got all manner of folks on board—volunteers looking for glory, petty criminals trying to dodge the noose, pressed men with nowhere else to turn. Holding this crew together was never going to be easy. But if we don’t get ahead of this, discipline’ll crack before we’ve even raised anchor. This envoy disappearing? It’s pouring fuel on that fire. Crew’s jittery enough without thinking we’re cursed before we’ve set sail."
>
> *He straightens, voice tightening.*  
> "We need answers. Fast. That envoy was finalizing our supplies and contracts. Without him, we stand to lose what little edge we have. Worse—if this is sabotage, it’s not just about missing supplies. Someone might not want us sailing at all. Or worse, they want us to sail and not come back. I’m not about to let that stand."
>
> "That’s where you come in. I picked you lot because you’re capable—or you’d better be. Find out what happened to the envoy. If he’s in trouble, pull him out. If he’s jumped ship with our coin or turned traitor, I trust you’ll know how to handle it. Whatever you find, I need this sorted, quiet and quick. No crew panic, no word spreading beyond who needs to know. We set sail on schedule, with or without him—but I’d damn well prefer with."
>
> *His gaze hardens, lingering on each player in turn.*  
> "Do this right, and you’ll have my thanks—and the crew’ll see that leadership aboard this ship isn’t to be questioned. Fail… and we head into cursed waters with a ship full of frightened men ready to jump at shadows. That’s a risk I’m not willing to take. Understood?"

### **Introduction**

The players are tasked with investigating the disappearance of **Enzo Falciere**, a Varenzan merchant involved in outfitting the expedition. What begins as a routine search turns into a chilling encounter with the supernatural, leading them to uncover the influence of the Stormcallers' Cult.

### **1. The Investigation Begins (Immediately After Godfrey’s Speech)**

**Goal:** Get the players moving in the right direction while giving them multiple leads to follow.

**Captain Elias Godfrey** informs the players that Falciere **vanished from dockside** while finalizing expedition supplies. The crew needs the missing provisions, but more pressingly, Varenza will demand answers.

The players may choose **one of three primary leads**:

#### **Primary Leads & Investigation Details**

- **Falciere’s Office (Merchant Records)**
  - Suspicious missing payment entry—suggests an off-the-books deal.
  - Unaccounted shipments in cargo manifests linked to Stormcaller agents.

- **His Warehouse (Managed by a Stormcaller "Hidden Hand")**
  - Overseer denies knowing anything, but a Stormcaller tattoo is hidden on his arm.
  - Signs of a struggle—bloodstains, broken crates, missing shipment.
  - If pressed too hard, he would rather die than betray the cult.

- **His Home (Distraught Wife)**
  - She knows nothing of the cult but is suspicious of:
    - Falciere often coming home soaked in seawater without explanation.
    - Leaving at odd hours, meeting unknown visitors.

#### **Fallback Lead (Dockside Gossip)**
- Dockworkers recall Falciere heading to a warehouse late at night.
- A nervous sailor mutters about strange chanting near the docks.

---
### **2. The Warehouse Investigation (Where It All Went Wrong)**

**Goal:** Show that Falciere’s betrayal of the Stormcallers led to his execution.

#### **What Players Find:**
- Signs of a Struggle – Bloodstains, a shattered lantern, upturned crates.
- A Ritual Symbol Drawn in Salt – A Stormcaller drowning sigil.
- An Unfinished Letter (Falciere’s handwriting):
  "I made a mistake. They know. If I disappear, tell Varenza that the sea is watching. I should never have—" (ink trails off).
- A Dockworker Witness – Saw hooded figures dragging Falciere toward the water but remained silent out of fear.

#### **The Turning Point**
- If players linger too long, they get a feeling of being watched.
- Something watches them from the tide...
- This directs them toward the final location.

---
### **3. The Descent into the Depths (Final Lead-Up to the Fight)**

**Goal:** Lead players to Falciere’s final resting place.

- **A Flooded Smuggler’s Warehouse (Chosen Location)**
  - Dilapidated warehouse, water seeping in through cracks.
  - Unnatural tide movement—as if the sea itself is reaching inside.
  - Something stirs beneath the surface...

---
### **4. The Final Fight: Enzo Falciere’s Undead Fate**

**Goal:** Reveal the truth—Falciere was executed by the Stormcallers, now cursed as The Drowned.

#### **How the Fight Unfolds**
1. Enzo awakens as a Draugr, his bloated, waterlogged corpse moving unnaturally.
2. Speaks in broken whispers: "The sea… does not… forgive…"
3. Combat Phases:
   - Phase 1: Unnatural Strength – Moves eerily fast, feels no pain.
   - Phase 2: The Drowned’s Curse – Water floods the room, seaweed tendrils drag at players.
   - Phase 3: The Final Grapple – Latches onto a player, trying to drag them under.

#### **When Defeated**
- His body remains still.
- Players must examine him to realize it’s Enzo Falciere.
- Loot/Clues from his Remains:
  - Stormcaller tattoos – Proof of cult involvement.
  - Torn Varenzan silk – Remnant of his merchant wealth.
  - A ruined signet ring – Noble crest, now worthless.

---
### **5. Final Choices & Consequences**

**How Will the Crew React?**
- Many see this as an omen—the expedition might be cursed.
- Morale could drop unless the players reassure or control the narrative.

**Do the Players Share the Truth?**
- Telling Varenza may escalate conflict with the Stormcallers.
- Keeping silent lets the mystery linger—but the cult now knows them.
