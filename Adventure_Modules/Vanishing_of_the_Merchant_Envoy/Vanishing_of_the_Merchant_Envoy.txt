# Adventure Module: The Vanishing of the Merchant Envoy

## Introductory Scene: Captain Godfrey\'s Cabin

The heavy oak door creaks shut behind the players as they step into
Captain Elias Godfrey\'s cabin. The room is spacious by shipboard
standards, its walls lined with maps---many of which end in blank spaces
beyond known coastlines---and shelves of navigational instruments. A
single lantern swings overhead, casting flickering light over the
cluttered desk where papers, sealed letters, and half-finished reports
lie in disarray. The air carries the familiar scents of salt, aged wood,
and faint tobacco smoke.

Captain Godfrey stands at the far side of the cabin, his uniform neat
despite the tension etched into his weathered face. His gray eyes shift
between the players as he leans forward, both hands planted on the
tabletop. Behind him, a small window frames the dark silhouette of the
port, illuminated by scattered lanterns and the distant glow of dockside
taverns. Outside, the soft creak of the hull and faint murmurs from the
crew echo the unease hanging over the ship.

Godfrey clears his throat, his voice a gravelly baritone shaped by
decades at sea and sharpened by authority.

### Captain Godfrey\'s Speech:

> \"No point dressing this up---we\'ve got a problem on our hands. The
> merchant envoy---the man who funded this entire venture---has gone
> missing. Vanished days before we're set to depart. And don't think for
> a second the crew hasn't noticed. Half of them are already whispering
> about curses and ill omens. Hell, with the waters we're sailing into,
> I can't entirely blame them. Most folk with sense steer clear of that
> stretch of sea. It's uncharted, it's dangerous, and ships that head
> out there... well, they're not known for coming back. And yet here we
> are.\"

He pauses, glancing at the maps before returning his gaze to the
players.

> \"We've got all manner of folks on board---volunteers looking for
> glory, petty criminals trying to dodge the noose, pressed men with
> nowhere else to turn. Holding this crew together was never going to be
> easy. But if we don't get ahead of this, discipline'll crack before
> we've even raised anchor. This envoy disappearing? It's pouring fuel
> on that fire. Crew's jittery enough without thinking we're cursed
> before we've set sail.\"

He straightens, voice tightening.

> \"We need answers. Fast. That envoy was finalizing our supplies and
> contracts. Without him, we stand to lose what little edge we have.
> Worse---if this is sabotage, it's not just about missing supplies.
> Someone might not want us sailing at all. Or worse, they want us to
> sail and not come back. I'm not about to let that stand.\"

> \"That's where you come in. I picked you lot because you're
> capable---or you'd better be. Find out what happened to the envoy. If
> he's in trouble, pull him out. If he's jumped ship with our coin or
> turned traitor, I trust you'll know how to handle it. Whatever you
> find, I need this sorted, quiet and quick. No crew panic, no word
> spreading beyond who needs to know. We set sail on schedule, with or
> without him---but I'd damn well prefer with.\"

## 1. Investigation Begins

The players must decide where to begin their search. Although Godfrey
has no great ideas, these should be obvious places, or in a pinch the
locals will be able to suggest these to players if asked, perhaps around
the docks or in local taverns and such places.

### 1.1 Falciere's Office

- Suspicious missing payment entry---suggests an off-the-books deal.
- Unaccounted shipments in cargo manifests linked to Stormcaller agents.
- Office contains encrypted correspondence (can be deciphered with
  effort).

### 1.2 Enzo's Warehouse

- The warehouse is owned by the Falciere family and managed by Matteo
  Caravelli.

- Matteo is secretly a Hidden Hand of the Stormcaller cult.

- Matteo is terrified of the Stormcallers, visibly nervous.

- He denies knowing anything but sweats profusely when confronted.

- His Stormcaller tattoo matches the one on Falciere's body.

- Signs of a struggle---bloodstains, broken lanterns, missing shipment.

- The warehouse is dimly lit, the smell of brine and old wood hanging in
  the air. The signs of violence are evident---blood smeared along the
  floor, crates smashed apart, a shattered lantern flickering in the
  gloom. The stillness is unsettling, broken only by the occasional
  creak of wood shifting in the tide.

- Signs of a Struggle: Blood, overturned crates, shattered lantern.

- A Ritual Symbol Drawn in Salt: A drowning sigil linked to the
  Stormcallers.

- An Unfinished Letter from Falciere\*\*:

  *\"I made a mistake. They know. If I disappear, tell Varenza that the
  sea is watching. I should never have---\"*

- Dockworker Witness: Saw hooded figures dragging Falciere toward the
  docks but refuses to talk.

#### Characters:

**Matteo Caravelli: The Terrified Overseer**

- **Appearance**: Early 40s, thinning hair, hollow cheeks, eyes darting
  constantly.

- **Personality**: Anxious, sweating profusely, refuses eye contact,
  terrified of saying too much.

- **Behavior & Roleplay Prompts**:

  - If questioned, Matteo first denies knowing anything, his voice
    shaky.
  - If pressed, he glances around nervously, as though expecting someone
    to be listening.
  - If confronted about his Stormcaller tattoo, he stammers and visibly
    recoils, cradling his wrist protectively.
  - If players grow aggressive, he pleads with them to stop, insisting:
    *\"You don't understand. It's worse than death. They drown you, but
    you don't die.\"*

- **What He WON'T Say**:

  - He refuses to explain the tattoo, only whispering, *\"It marks
    you.\"*
  - He won't give names, only shaking his head violently when asked
    about who took Falciere.
  - If players threaten him further, he breaks down completely, sobbing,
    but still offers no concrete information.
  - **Final Dire Warning**: If players leave him alone, Matteo mutters
    as they walk away: *\"It's too late for you now. The sea is
    watching.\"*

### 1.3 Falciere's Home -- The Domestic Scene

#### Location & Atmosphere:

The Falciere estate is modest but well-kept, a comfortable townhome that
reflects a rising merchant family\'s wealth---fine but not extravagant.
The home is quiet, tense, as if a heavy shadow hangs over it. The
household servants have been dismissed since Enzo's disappearance,
leaving only his wife and their young child behind.\
**Stormcaller Symbolism?** If a player has knowledge of cult markings,
they might recognize a faintly etched sigil hidden on Enzo's work desk
or personal effects.

#### Characters:

**Vittoria Falciere (Distraught Wife)**

- **Age**: Mid-20s

- **Appearance**: Elegant but weary; dark hair tied back in a simple
  braid, eyes red from crying.

- **Personality**: Conflicted---grieving but angry at her husband's
  secrets.

- **State of Mind**:

  - She doesn't know about the Stormcallers.
  - She suspects her husband was involved in something secretive.
  - She has been kept in the dark, yet worries that his actions have now
    endangered them.
  - Guilt-ridden---her last words to him before his disappearance were
    harsh, frustrated by his late nights and strange behavior.

- **What She Can Reveal**:

  - His Late-Night Absences: Enzo would leave unexpectedly at night,
    always without explanation. He sometimes returned before dawn,
    soaking wet, clothes heavy with seawater. When asked, he dismissed
    it as *\"merchant business\"*, but she never believed him.
  - Strange Visitors: In the weeks before he vanished, unfamiliar men
    visited him---always late at night. They spoke softly but intensely,
    and she never saw their faces. One night, she heard them chanting.
  - Hidden Fears: She confesses she had begun to fear her husband---not
    because he threatened her, but because he was becoming someone she
    didn't recognize. Some nights, he stared into the dark, whispering
    strange words. He became obsessed with the sea, listening to the
    tide as if it were speaking to him.

- **Where This Leads**:

  - Vittoria's testimony reinforces the mystery:
  - Enzo was tied to something unnatural.
  - He had visitors connected to the cult.
  - He was drawn to the sea, almost as if it called to him.

**Marco Falciere (The Child)**

- **Age**: 4 years old

- **Appearance**: Dark curls, big eyes, clings to his mother.

- **Personality**: Shy, fearful of strangers, but curious.

- **State of Mind**:

  - Doesn't understand what's happening.
  - Knows *\"Papa is missing.\"*
  - Has overheard more than his mother realizes.

- **What He Might Reveal** (If the Players Gain His Trust):

  - *\"Papa talked to the ocean.\"* -- He saw his father murmuring
    toward the waves on multiple occasions.
  - *\"A man with no face came here.\"* -- One of the visitors wore a
    hood and had a whispery voice.
  - *\"Mama said Papa was bad.\"* -- A reference to a fight between
    Vittoria and Enzo the night before he vanished.

- **Player Interactions & Outcomes**

  - **Comfort & Reassurance**: If the players treat Vittoria and Marco
    kindly, she opens up more.
  - **Aggressive Questioning**: If pressured, she becomes defensive,
    shutting down or demanding they leave.
  - **Subtle Observations**: The players might notice a child's
    drawing---Marco scribbled odd symbols he saw his father making.

## 2. **The Tidal Temple of the Drowned God**

## **Overview**

This **forgotten temple**, carved into the **cliffs**, is only
accessible at **low tide**. It was once a **place of sacrifice** to an
**ancient sea deity**, but its history has been **eroded by time**. The
murals and ruins hint at a **civilization long vanished**, yet the
presence of **recent disturbances** suggests someone has been **using it
for their own purposes**.

The **players initially believe** they have uncovered the **ruins of a
lost cult**, with **no knowledge of the Stormcallers' involvement**.
**They are wrong.**

## **Getting to the Temple: The Tide-Runner & the Skipper**

The players need to **hire a local boatman** with a **small but sturdy
coastal launch**---a **tide-runner**---to ferry them inside.

- The **skipper** is reluctant to approach, warning:

  *\"I'll drop you at the cave, but I ain't sticking around. You get two
  hours---******then the tide's got you******.\"*

- A **signal** is agreed upon---a **flare, a lantern flash, or a horn
  blast**---to call the boat back.

- The **ride is tense**, the cliffs **looming**, the waves **crashing
  like warning drums**.

### **The First Shock: The Boat Leaves**

- As soon as the players **step onto the rocky shore**, the **boat
  abruptly turns and departs**.
- It **vanishes into the darkness**, leaving them **alone** in the cave.
- **Let them panic.** Let them **think they were abandoned**.
- After a minute or two, they **see it waiting, just outside the cave**,
  keeping its distance.

> *The tide-runner pivots sharply, retreating into the night. The sound
> of its oars vanishes, leaving only the echo of the waves against the
> stone. The cave yawns before you, dark and gaping. Then... silence. A
> deep, endless silence.*

## **Temple Layout (5 Rooms & a Rockfall Event)**

### **Room 1: The Entrance Cave**

- A **natural cavern**, slick with seawater.
- The **only visible light** comes from the **cave mouth behind them**.
- The **stone archway ahead**, carved into the rock, is
  **half-submerged**.
- **Faint carvings** hint at **forgotten rituals**---waves swallowing
  figures **with outstretched arms**.

> *The air smells of salt and damp stone. Ahead, the passage looms, its
> archway half-claimed by the sea. The tide pools at your feet,
> retreating with a whisper. Somewhere deep inside, something drips. The
> silence is heavier than the air itself.*

A **corridor leads to the next chamber**.

### **Room 2: The Antechamber of Offerings**

- **Blackened basins** along the walls, once used for **sacrificial
  gifts**.
- **Coins, rusted trinkets, and broken idols** litter the ground.
- **Murals of a faceless sea god**, its arms outstretched, **partially
  eroded**.
- **A ritual dagger**, crusted with **salt and time**, lies discarded.

> *This place feels forgotten, its rites left to rot. The murals show
> kneeling figures, their heads bowed, arms raised toward something
> vast. But time has stolen the god's face, leaving only the impression
> of something... watching.*

A **narrow passage leads deeper into the temple**.

### **Room 3: The Rockfall Passage (Trap Event)**

As the players move **deeper into the passage**, they **spot danger**---

- **A player rolls well** and **notices cracks** in the ceiling.
- **Dust drifts down. The stone above groans.**
- Before they can react---**DOWN IT COMES.**

#### **The Collapse**

- A **roar of breaking rock**---stone **slams into the ground behind
  them**.
- A **blast of dust and debris** blinds them **for several moments**.
- **The way back is now gone.** The **only way is forward.**

> *The groan becomes a crack, the crack becomes a roar. The ground
> shakes as the ceiling gives way, and in an instant, the passage behind
> you is devoured by falling stone. A deafening silence follows. The
> dust hangs in the air like smoke. You\'re trapped.*

#### **Crossing the Rubble**

- **Not an impassable wall, but unstable and dangerous.**

- Players must **climb across loose rock**---a skill challenge.

- **Hazards:**

  - **Falling debris** (if they move carelessly).
  - **Slipping on unstable footing**.
  - **Dust makes visibility poor**.

A **narrow opening leads into the shrine**.

### **Room 4: The Drowning Shrine**

- A **large, waterlogged chamber**, an **altar** in its center.
- **Walls lined with eroded carvings**---sacrifices being **led into the
  sea**.
- **The altar is cracked, but not abandoned.**
- **A dagger lies there, its blade salt-rusted but still sharp.**
- **The air is thick with silence.**

> *The altar is broken, but its presence is undeniable. The stone is
> slick with centuries of water, yet something about it still feels...
> waiting. The carvings whisper of a time when men gave themselves to
> the tide. And perhaps, in some way, they still do.*

A **wide opening at the rear of the shrine leads to Enzo's Lair**.

### **Room 5: Enzo's Lair (Final Encounter)**

- A **circular, water-filled chamber**, with a **deep, black pool** at
  its center.
- The **only light comes from above**, where **a crack in the rock lets
  in the moonlight**.
- **The pool churns. Something rises.**

> *The water suddenly moves, sloshing over the stone. A shadow takes
> shape beneath the surface. Then---he ******rises.****** Enzo Falciere,
> bloated and rotting, his eyes clouded, his lips dripping brine. He
> stands there, the water still pouring from his lungs, and his mouth
> moves in a whisper of a voice that should not be able to speak.*

> *\"You... should not... be here.\"*

#### **The Battle with Enzo**

- **His strength is unnatural**---his **body waterlogged but unnervingly
  fast**.

- The **pool regenerates him** unless **it is disrupted**.

- **Final desperation move:** He **grabs a player**, trying to **pull
  them into the pool**---

  - If **successful**, they must **fight to escape drowning**.
  - If **they resist**, **Enzo screeches** in rage and **summons a water
    hazard**---the **pool erupts in violent waves.**

## 3. Final Encounter: Enzo Falciere, The Drowned

As the players explore, the water suddenly surges as something stirs
beneath the surface. From the darkness, Enzo Falciere emerges---a
drowned, bloated mockery of the man he once was. His eyes are clouded,
his flesh pallid, and seaweed coils around his limbs like living
tendrils.

### 3.1 Descriptive Horror Elements:

- His voice is broken, unnatural. He speaks as though water still fills
  his lungs.
- His fingers twitch erratically, as if resisting his own actions.
- Water drips endlessly from his form, yet he never dries.
- His face is distorted, stretched unnaturally, mouth slightly too wide,
  eyes sunken and hollow.

### GURPS Combat Stats & Mechanics:

- **ST (Strength)**: 15
- **DX (Dexterity)**: 12
- **IQ (Intelligence)**: 9
- **HT (Health)**: 14
- **HP (Hit Points)**: 20
- **Move**: 6
- **DR (Damage Resistance)**: 2 (tough, bloated flesh)
- **Resistances**: Takes half damage from all damage types except
  cutting/slashing.

#### Weapon:

- **Falciere Family Falchion (Fine, Balanced, Engraved)**

  - **Damage**: Swing+2 cutting
  - **Bonus**: Fine quality (+1 damage), high-value heirloom (\$2,500).
  - **Additional Effect**: Players may recognize its heraldry and
    craftsmanship, making it a valuable artifact.

### Combat Phases & Tactics:

- **Phase 1: Unnatural Strength**

  - Moves with eerie, unnatural speed despite bloated, waterlogged
    limbs.
  - Shrugs off pain and continues attacking relentlessly.
  - Speaks in broken, guttural whispers: *\"You\... should not\... be
    here\...\"*
  - Uses sweeping slashes with his falchion, attempting to wound
    multiple opponents.

- **Phase 2: The Drowned's Curse (Triggered at half HP):**

  - Water floods the room, making footing treacherous (-1 penalty to
    DX-based rolls).
  - Spectral hands and seaweed attempt to grapple players (ST 12 to
    resist).
  - Dense fog and unnatural mist obscure vision (-2 penalty to
    perception-based checks).

- **Phase 3: The Final Grapple:**

  - As a last desperate act, Enzo attempts an all-out grapple attack
    (ST 15) to drag a player into the water.
  - If successful, the player must make a contest of ST vs. 15 or begin
    drowning.

### Scaling Options (if the fight is too easy):

- Brief regeneration when in contact with seawater (+2 HP per round if
  submerged).
- Temporary DR increase (DR 3) for a short duration, representing
  supernatural resilience.
- Fright check (-2 penalty) for first-time viewers of his horrific
  transformation.

### Upon Defeat:

Falciere collapses motionless, allowing players to examine his remains.

#### Clues left behind:

- Stormcaller tattoos confirming cult involvement.
- Ruined noble signet ring identifying him unmistakably.
- Torn Varenzan silk, remnants of his former life.
- His family falchion, now a valuable heirloom and potential reward.

## 4. Consequences & Aftermath

### Returning the Falciere Family Sword (Optional Reward Scenario):

If players return the sword to Vittoria Falciere:

- She is deeply grateful but shaken by the truth.
- The family commits to honoring Enzo's financial obligations, securing
  expedition resources.
- Players receive a personal cash reward (\$500--\$1,000, adjustable)
  before departure.

#### Future Implications:

The Falciere name may become a valuable connection in the future.

### The Stormcaller Cult Now Knows Them

The players have stumbled onto something much larger than a simple
disappearance.

- Matteo's warnings were true---*"the sea is watching."*
- Future encounters may see strange events, cultist spies, or whispered
  threats from unseen figures.
- The crew remains uneasy, with some whispering about bad omens.

Returning Enzo's heirloom sword to Vittoria secures funding for the
expedition and earns the players a significant personal reward. However,
the Stormcallers now know of them, setting the stage for future dangers.
