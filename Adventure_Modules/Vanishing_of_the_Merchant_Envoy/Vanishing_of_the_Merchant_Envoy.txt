# **Adventure Module: The Vanishing of the Merchant Envoy**
## **Scene: Captain Godfrey's Cabin**

The heavy oak door creaks shut behind the players as they step into Captain Elias Godfrey's cabin. The room is spacious by shipboard standards, its walls lined with maps—many of which end in blank spaces beyond the known coastlines—and shelves of navigational instruments. A single lantern swings overhead, casting flickering light over the cluttered desk where papers, sealed letters, and half-finished reports lie in disarray. The air carries the familiar scents of salt, aged wood, and faint tobacco smoke.

Captain Godfrey stands at the far side of the cabin, his uniform neat despite the tension etched into his weathered face. His gray eyes shift between the players as he leans forward, both hands planted on the tabletop. Behind him, a small window frames the dark silhouette of the port, illuminated by scattered lanterns and the distant glow of dockside taverns. Outside, the soft creak of the hull and faint murmurs from the crew echo the unease hanging over the ship.

Godfrey clears his throat, his voice a gravelly baritone shaped by decades at sea and sharpened by authority.

> **Captain Godfrey's Speech:**  
> "No point dressing this up—we've got a problem on our hands. The merchant envoy—the man who funded this entire venture—has gone missing. Vanished days before we’re set to depart. And don’t think for a second the crew hasn’t noticed. Half of them are already whispering about curses and ill omens. Hell, with the waters we’re sailing into, I can’t entirely blame them. Most folk with sense steer clear of that stretch of sea. It’s uncharted, it’s dangerous, and ships that head out there… well, they’re not known for coming back. And yet here we are."
>
> *He pauses, glancing at the maps before returning his gaze to the players.*  
> "We’ve got all manner of folks on board—volunteers looking for glory, petty criminals trying to dodge the noose, pressed men with nowhere else to turn. Holding this crew together was never going to be easy. But if we don’t get ahead of this, discipline’ll crack before we’ve even raised anchor. This envoy disappearing? It’s pouring fuel on that fire. Crew’s jittery enough without thinking we’re cursed before we’ve set sail."
>
> *He straightens, voice tightening.*  
> "We need answers. Fast. That envoy was finalizing our supplies and contracts. Without him, we stand to lose what little edge we have. Worse—if this is sabotage, it’s not just about missing supplies. Someone might not want us sailing at all. Or worse, they want us to sail and not come back. I’m not about to let that stand."
>
> "That’s where you come in. I picked you lot because you’re capable—or you’d better be. Find out what happened to the envoy. If he’s in trouble, pull him out. If he’s jumped ship with our coin or turned traitor, I trust you’ll know how to handle it. Whatever you find, I need this sorted, quiet and quick. No crew panic, no word spreading beyond who needs to know. We set sail on schedule, with or without him—but I’d damn well prefer with."
>
> *His gaze hardens, lingering on each player in turn.*  
> "Do this right, and you’ll have my thanks—and the crew’ll see that leadership aboard this ship isn’t to be questioned. Fail… and we head into cursed waters with a ship full of frightened men ready to jump at shadows. That’s a risk I’m not willing to take. Understood?"


## **Stormcallers' Influence in the Vanishing of the Merchant Envoy**

The players will only find **subtle hints** of the Stormcallers’ involvement in the disappearance of **Enzo Falciere**, enough to spark curiosity but not expose the full extent of the cult’s actions.

### **Clues the Players May Discover:**
1. **A Missing Ledger Entry** – Among Falciere’s notes, there is an **incomplete transaction**—a payment that was **never recorded**, meant for **someone unknown**.  
2. **A Whispered Warning** – A frightened dockworker mutters, **“The sea does not want you here.”** When questioned further, he refuses to speak.  
3. **A Symbol in the Salt** – Near where Falciere was last seen, a **symbol has been drawn in wet salt**—it looks like a stylized wave, or perhaps an eye staring from the deep.  
4. **A Sailor’s Nightmare** – A crewman claims to have **dreamed of a man drowning in the dark**—a man that looks like Falciere.  
5. **A Ship that Should Not Be There** – A lone vessel, seen **only at dusk and dawn**, that never enters port and **vanishes with the fog**.
