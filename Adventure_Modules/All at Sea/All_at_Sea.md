# Incident One: "Learning the Ropes"

### Scene Timing
**Day 2 at sea**  
Clear skies, strong wind—ideal conditions for crew training.

---

## OBJECTIVES

- Put players physically and narratively into shipboard life.
- Introduce Lt. Drake and Boatswain “Iron Meg” Kincaid through action.
- Build trust, tension, and discipline themes through *human* danger.
- Let players get their hands dirty—succeed or fail with consequences.
- Deliver a memorable mix of danger, chaos, and gallows humour.

---

## SCENE FLOW

### BEAT 1: Setup – "Rope Drill"

**Prompt**:  
> *“It’s your third day at sea. The Sojourner rides the wind steady, sails full. A good day—at least on paper. But for you? It’s rope drill.”*

Boatswain Kincaid is running a **training exercise for officers and specialists**—including the players—to teach basic rigging skills. Her philosophy:  
> *“If it keeps you above the waterline, you bloody well ought to know how to do it.”*

**NPC Roles**:
- **Lt. Drake** – Acting as a confident instructor, energetic but casual.
- **Iron Meg** – On deck, pacing like a predator. Whistle in hand.

**Player Involvement**:  
Ask each PC: *Where are you during the drill?*  
Options:
- Hands-on with ropes
- Overseeing lines
- Up in the rigging
- Watching from the deck
- Trying to disappear

---

### BEAT 2: Trouble Brews

**Trigger**:  
Pick a PC randomly or roll Perception / Seamanship.

> *“One line catches your eye—too pale, too dry. It doesn’t look right. The wind pulls it tight, and something in your gut says it’s wrong. You have seconds.”*

**Choices**:
- Shout a warning (Leadership, Fast-Talk, CHA)
- Climb to intervene (DX or Acrobatics – difficult)
- Try to brace or haul the rope (ST or Rope Use)
- Freeze and see it snap

> **Note**: Even on success, the rope will still break—the players can reduce harm, not prevent it.

---

### BEAT 3: SNAP AND CHAOS

**Event**:
- Rope parts with a loud **CRACK**
- Sail flaps free, snapping taut
- One junior sailor thrown into the gunwale—badly injured
- Deck erupts into shouting and confusion

**Player Reactions**:

| Action                   | Skill                   | Outcome                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Secure flapping sail     | Rope Use, DX             | Prevents further sail damage     |
| Haul injured crewman     | ST, DX                   | Prevents worsening the injury     |
| Bark orders at panicking crew | Leadership         | Restores partial order           |
| Climb to brace rigging   | Acrobatics, Seamanship   | Secures upper rigging             |
| Creative problem-solving | Seamanship or IQ         | Novel fix, improvisation          |
| Do nothing / fail roll   | —                        | Adds chaos or leads to comic result |

---

### COMEDY MOMENT: The Dangling Disaster

If a PC fails a roll (or just for flavour):

- A PC (or crewman) ends up **dangling upside down**, about three feet off the deck
- Rope wrapped around their ankle, spinning slowly
- One boot has fallen off

**Iron Meg (deadpan)**:  
> *“Comfortable, are we?”*  
> *“Anyone else fancy learning your knots the hard way?”*

(Line might unspool just afterward, dropping the victim unceremoniously.)

---

### BEAT 4: Aftermath – The Dust Settles

**Injuries**:
- One sailor down with a compound leg break
- Sail slightly damaged
- Temporary rigging loss, now being repaired

**NPC Reactions**:
- **Iron Meg** (to all):  
  > *“That’s why we practice now. Not when the sky’s black and the sea’s trying to eat us.”*

  Then, to crew dragging the wounded:  
  > *“Haul him below. If he can scream, he can breathe.”*

- **Lt. Drake**:  
  - If PCs acted well:  
    > *“Good eyes. You might just have a sailor’s spine under there.”*
  - If PCs froze or hesitated:  
    > *“Next time, move first. We don’t always get second ones.”*

**Optional Player Investigation**:
- Rope can be examined later
- Seamanship / Ropecraft reveals dry rot or poor treatment
- Could be tied to bad port supplies or just neglected inventory

---

### BEAT 5: Transition Forward

- Crew tension rising
- Whispered rumours begin (“Bad luck this early...”)
- Nyxie spotted walking the spar, tail twitching

---

### PLAYER NOTE: Morgan’s Seamanship

Morgan has **notably high Seamanship**. This is an ideal moment for him to:
- Spot the rope flaw before the break
- Take control of part of the crisis
- Earn praise from Meg or Drake

Prompt if needed:
> *“Morgan—you’ve seen lines like this fail before. What do you do?”*

---

# Incident Two: "The Whispering Hold"

### Scene Timing  
**Day 2 – Night**  
Later the same day as the rope incident. The ship has calmed—but the crew hasn’t.

---

## Scene Objectives

- Transition from action to tension and unease.
- Introduce a crewman (Torrin) whose legitimate resentment boils over into unacceptable action.
- Let players lead an investigation with potential to change the outcome—but not avoid it easily.
- Use Nyxie and crew behaviour to foreshadow the situation.
- Lead directly into the next day’s public punishment.

---

## BEAT 1: Rumours and Shadows

It starts small.

A few crewmen mutter over mess about **strange noises** from the **aft hold**—**clinks**, **dragging**, **shifting barrels**, and **footsteps where there shouldn’t be any**.

> *“Maybe a rat got into the dry stores.”*  
> *“Heard it twice now. Like something scraping just under the floorboards.”*

Then **Nyxie** starts acting strange.

She parks herself just outside the open hatch to the hold—**low, tense, tail twitching**, ears flat to her skull. Her pupils are wide. She growls—**quiet and steady**, like a kettle just short of boiling. She hasn’t moved in an hour.

That’s when a **committee of lower-deck sailors** forms nearby. No one steps forward. They just **stand in a half-circle**, glancing at each other and the cat.

Someone whispers:
> *“She knows. Animals always do.”*

Another:
> *“Saw one of the officers carry a black-handled knife below the other night. Maybe it's cursed.”*

> *“Could be the envoy. Heard he died below decks. Never said how.”*

The speculation thickens. Meg arrives midway through a tale involving “bad luck in the water barrel” and one lad asking if salt lines work on ships.

She looks at the scene—Nyxie staring into shadow, crew clustered like children before a locked door—and **lets out a slow sigh through her nose**.

> **Iron Meg:**  
> *“Right. That’s enough ghost watching.”*  
> *“You lot—come with me. Bring a lantern. We’re going to settle whatever superstitious nonsense this is before it turns into a proper panic.”*  
> *“If there’s a curse on this hold, I’ll have a word with it myself.”*

Then she climbs to fetch the players.

---

## BEAT 2: Descent into the Hold

Meg returns with the players in tow.

The aft hold is cramped, dark, and heavy with the smells of dust, pitch, and alcohol. The lantern creaks slightly as it swings. Crates are stacked tight. There’s just enough room to move single-file.

Signs of tampering:
- A **small pry tool** discarded beside a **grog cask**
- **Three empty mugs**, one rolling on its side
- The **bung knocked clean** from the cask
- A sour, heavy **reek of spilled grog**

**Torrin** is there:
- Slumped against the barrel, **drenched in drink**, barely upright
- Slurring, swaying, flushed with rage and rum
- His eyes flicker in the lantern light—**aware**, angry, and unashamed

> *“Look who’s come to drag me to the lash. Go on then. Or take your turn.”*

---

## BEAT 3: Escalation

Torrin is **drunk**, **volatile**, and has **no intention of apologising**.

> *“Dragged from the docks for this? Biscuit, salt meat, and shouting? You call that duty?”*

He rants about press-ganging, injustice, and the officers who “sip wine while we sweat.”

---

### Player Intervention Opportunity

Allow players to attempt to calm or de-escalate.  
- Leadership, Persuasion, Fast-Talk, or Diplomacy (at a **-4 penalty**)
- Only one PC may attempt; others can assist with prior setup or RP
- **On exceptional success**: Torrin surrenders, spits, and slumps—disarmed, but still bitter. Hargrave may assign confinement and ration cut instead of flogging.

**On failure or inaction**:  
Torrin **lashes out**. If Meg is present and nearest (likely), he swings at her.

> *“You think she’s better than me? She’s the chain that holds the lash!”*

---

## BEAT 4: The Blow

**Torrin swings**—a clumsy, drunken punch.

Meg **sidesteps easily** and **cracks her cane** hard across his shin. He goes down instantly, groaning, barely conscious.

> **Iron Meg (coldly):**  
> *“He’s just earned himself a lesson the crew won’t forget.”*

---

## BEAT 5: The Report

**Torrin is placed under guard**, sobering fast.

When reported to **First Lieutenant Hargrave**, she delivers sentence without emotion:

> **Hargrave:**  
> *“He’s stolen from the ship’s stores, stoked fear among the men, and struck a superior.”*  
> *“Default will be at eight bells in the afternoon watch.”*

No elaboration. No appeal. The **crew will learn of it by morning**.

The rumour spreads like smoke:
> *“He went for Meg.”*  
> *“Didn’t even hesitate.”*  
> *“Dead man walking.”*

---

## Scene Outcome

- **Torrin’s flogging is now inevitable.**
- The players may feel conflicted—he’s angry, and he’s wrong—but he’s also *not entirely unjustified*.
- The crew’s fear gives way to something sharper: the **reminder that the ship runs on discipline**—and there are lines you do not cross.
