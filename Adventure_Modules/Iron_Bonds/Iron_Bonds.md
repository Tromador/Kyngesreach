# Adventure: Iron Bonds

## Adventure Overview

The Sojourner encounters the Iron Tide pirates for the first time when they come across an Iron Tide brig attacking a merchant ship. After a dangerous rescue operation, the crew unknowingly picks up disguised pirates among the survivors, setting the stage for mutiny. The adventure spotlights both naval combat and diplomatic skills, particularly giving Calloway opportunities to shine, while also introducing a young herbalist/alchemist NPC.

## Introduction - Godfrey's Speech

*(Godfrey stands at the quarterdeck, his steady gaze sweeping the crew as the morning light catches the sails. His voice, firm and measured, carries over the ship’s deck.)*

“Crew of the Sojourner—listen.  
We’ve faced more than most crews could endure, and we’ve come through—not by chance, but by resolve and discipline. 
When shadows whispered below decks, it was unity that saw us through. 
When strange lands tempted us to lose our way, we kept to our course and faced what lay beyond the reefs with clear eyes and steady hands.

We’ve seen men stranded beyond the reach of time, and we’ve stood together when the sea itself seemed to rise against us. 
We faced foes who knew no fear, and when the beasts of the land lent their strength to ours, it was not charity—it was respect for those who refused to bend.

Today, I won’t tell you it will be easy, or certain. 
But this ship is built not just of timber and sail—it’s made of the bond between each of us. 
Keep to your duties. Stand firm in your trust of one another. That is how we sail. That is how we endure.”

*(A final, resolute nod. Godfrey’s hand lifts, signaling the helmsman, and the ship begins to make way.)*

If she does it:

## 🌀 Biele’s Air Jet Knockback – Narrative Prompt

As the Iron Tide pirate lunges forward, cutlass raised high, Biele plants her feet and thrusts her hands forward. The air around her seems to tense, drawing in like a breath before a storm. Then—

With a sharp crack, an invisible **jet of compressed air** explodes from her palms. The pirate’s charge halts mid-step, his feet skidding backward across the damp deck. His eyes widen in a moment of sheer disbelief as the force of the spell doubles, driving him bodily toward the rail.

The wooden gunwale slams into his back with a hollow thud. For a heartbeat, he teeters—arms windmilling, cutlass falling from his grasp—before tumbling **backward into empty air**. The sea swallows him with a sharp splash, leaving only ripples and the faint bob of his hat as the crew erupts in shouts of disbelief and approval.

For the first time, the air seems to **whip playfully around Biele**, teasing her hair and skirts, as though even the elements are celebrating her triumph.

---

## Scene 2: Urgent Rescue Operation

- **Setup:**  
  The crew scrambles to rescue survivors from the rapidly sinking merchant ship.
  
  # 📜 Scene 2 Narratives – Merchantman and Brig Searches

## Merchantman Search (If Afloat)

*(Aboard the listing merchantman, the air is thick with the mingled scents of salt, smoke, and spilled wine. The survivors, weary and beaten but still coherent, rally to assist as soon as the Sojourner’s boats come alongside. Their uniforms are threadbare, their faces hollowed by days of terror, but they leap to help as lines are secured and planks thrown across.)*

Captain Godfrey nods curtly.  
> *“Let’s see if this wreck’s worth saving.”*

The surviving merchant sailors guide the searchers below, moving with the anxious precision of men who know their ship’s skeleton intimately. In the shadowed hold, amid splintered crates and broken casks, a cache of **salt fish**, **textiles**, and **dried herbs** is revealed, hastily secured during the battle.

> *“There’s not much,”* one merchant mutters, wiping sweat from his brow. *“But it’ll keep your bellies full, and ours for a bit longer.”*

With coordinated haste, lines and pulleys creak as provisions are transferred from the **Morningstar**’s listing decks to the Sojourner’s boats. Crewmen—both rescued and rescuers—work shoulder to shoulder, their common purpose momentarily dissolving the barriers of suspicion. The **salt fish barrels**, so precious now, thud reassuringly against the Sojourner’s deck.

Above, the damaged masts creak ominously as the merchantman lists further.

> *“That’s it,”* someone calls. *“She won’t stay up much longer. Cut the lines!”*

The searchers scramble back to safety as the Morningstar groans, her fate now sealed.

---

## Brig Search (If Afloat)

*(Aboard the captured brig, the air is sour with sweat, gunpowder, and spilled grog. Shadows pool in the narrow corridors as searchers pick their way through the debris of battle. The timbers groan, the deck cants sharply underfoot, but the Sojourner’s boarding parties push on, weapons ready.)*

Deeper in the brig’s stifling lower decks, the scent of damp rot and human misery thickens. In a makeshift galley, a **gaunt, wide-eyed prisoner** stirs a slop of unidentifiable stew. Another, an older man with a broken hand, labours to patch a sail. The Iron Tide captors clearly pressed these souls into servitude.

Then, in a low, dark compartment near the stern—a storage room turned cell—the searchers find her. **A young girl, perhaps thirteen**, huddled against a splintered barrel. Her clothes are ragged, her skin smudged with grime, and her wrists bear the angry marks of rope burns. Her dark eyes, large and haunted, flick to the searchers with a mix of fear and exhausted hope.

A battered wooden crate beside her holds bundles of **dried herbs and alchemical ingredients**, along with a small, soot-smeared mortar and pestle.

A Sojourner sailor murmurs:  
> *“Poor thing… how long’s she been down here?”*

The girl flinches as a lantern is raised, but doesn’t retreat. She clutches a small leather pouch to her chest—its contents unknown for now.

Above, the groaning timbers warn of the brig’s imminent demise. The searchers know they have only moments to gather the prisoners—and the girl—before the sea claims the ship.

# 👧 Adwen – Alchemist Girl Backstory

**Name:** Adwen  
**Age:** 13  
**Origin:** Native of the small, isolated village of **Tathryn's Cove**, a settlement hidden deep within the Kyngesreach. Raised amid dense jungle and coastal bluffs, Adwen learned the basics of herbalism and alchemy from the village healer, **Eris Marthen**, a stern but knowledgeable woman with a knack for wild plants and simple remedies.

Adwen’s talent with herbs and her careful, deliberate approach earned her an apprenticeship of sorts, but her education was cut short when she was abducted by the Iron Tide during a raid on her village. The pirates recognised her skills and forced her aboard the brig, where she was set to work brewing basic potions and maintaining the ship’s limited stores of healing herbs.

**Skills:**  
- **Herbalism:** Practical knowledge of wild plants, focusing on basic treatments, poultices, and remedies common in the Reach.  
- **Alchemy:** Capable of preparing simple potions—healing draughts, stimulants, and perhaps rudimentary poisons—using improvised materials.

**Personality:**  
Adwen is quiet and slow to trust, haunted by her abduction and the violence she’s witnessed. She clings to a battered leather pouch containing precious seeds and dried herbs from her village, her only link to her past. While withdrawn, she may slowly open up to a kind and patient figure—perhaps Calloway, Biele, or another PC showing her compassion.

**Key Note:**  
Adwen **does not know how to return home**. Her village, Tathryn's Cove, is remote and difficult to reach, and she was taken aboard the brig in darkness, with no chance to mark her bearings. Any attempts by players to extract a “shortcut” home will be met with regretful, apologetic confusion.

**Visual Cues:**  
- Long, tangled dark hair.  
- Ragged, oversized tunic.  
- Grimy but delicate hands, callused from grinding herbs and tending pots.  
- Eyes large and wary, shadowed by exhaustion.

  # 📚 Merchantman Backstory – Morningstar

The merchantman **Morningstar** is a medium-sized trade vessel operating out of **Varenza**, known for supplying remote settlements in the Kyngesreach. She departed almost three months ago on a routine supply run and was marked missing by Captain Godfrey. However, for the Morningstar’s crew, the disappearance seems to have lasted only ten days—a subtle but telling sign of the Kyngesreach’s peculiar temporal effects.

## Key Details:
- **Captain:** Bren Calven (killed in the Iron Tide attack)
- **Cargo:** 
  - Salt fish (500 kg total; approximately 2,250 man-meals = ~6.5 days of full rations for the Sojourner’s crew)
  - Casks of cheap wine
  - Bolts of cloth
  - Bundles of dried herbs
- **Crew:** A mix of Varenza locals and Kyngesreach traders; minimal combat skill.
- **Condition at Rescue:** 
  - Hull severely breached, deck burning or damaged.
  - Survivors adrift on debris, exhausted and demoralised.
  - Supplies nearly exhausted.

## Narrative Role:
The Morningstar’s discovery in Scene 1 adds emotional weight to the Sojourner’s engagement:
- Recognisable name from Godfrey’s list of missing ships.
- No valuable navigational data—no shortcut maps or ship logs.
- The **salt fish cargo offers a critical resupply opportunity** if the players act decisively.

## Temporal Discrepancy:
The Morningstar crew believes they’ve only been missing for days, but their ship has been absent from records for nearly three months. This reinforces the subtle, disorienting nature of the Kyngesreach and sets up narrative consistency with earlier story arcs.

- **Event details:**  
  - Amid chaotic rescue conditions, several disguised Iron Tide crew infiltrate the rescued merchant survivors unnoticed.  
  - Emphasize the confusion and urgency of the scene to obscure the infiltration.
  
- **Rescue aboard Iron Tide brig:**  
  Players can board the pirate ship before it fully sinks to quickly search for supplies or survivors.

  - **Key encounter:**  
    Discovery of a small group of traumatized captives, including a girl in her early teens.  
  - **NPC (Alchemist Girl):**  
    - Severely traumatised, withdrawn, suffering PTSD-like symptoms.  
    - Possesses significant knowledge of herbs and alchemy, capable of producing healing potions and other beneficial concoctions once brought out of her shell.
  - Emphasize gentle, sensitive roleplay opportunities here, ideal for Calloway or socially adept characters.

- **Outcome:**  
  Survivors and prisoners safely aboard Sojourner, along with hidden Iron Tide infiltrators. Sinking pirate vessel lost.

# Scene 3: Fractures Below Decks

## Overview
A sudden sabotage incident throws the ship into chaos. Torrin becomes the prime suspect, but his guilt—or innocence—is a pivot point shaped by player actions, particularly Morgan’s. Meanwhile, background suspicions mount as mutiny brews unseen.

"Why do you care what happens to me, Lieutenant? Men like me—if we get to stand tall, it’s only on a noose."
---

## Scene Flow

### 🔥 Inciting Incident – Sabotage in the Hold
- **Setup**: Crew discovers smouldering slow fuse and sabotage in the powder hold (or key ship system).
- **Response**: Players must:
  - Extinguish threat (DX/Seamanship/Strength rolls).
  - Secure the area and prevent panic.
- **Immediate Consequences**:
  - Rumours spread: “Who did it?”
  - Torrin is seen nearby, either genuinely helping or coincidentally present.

### 🎭 Torrin in the Spotlight
- **Accusations**: Crew suspect Torrin due to his past flogging and rough reputation.
- **Morgan’s Role**:  
  - **Approach Options**:
    - Direct confrontation (Leadership/Diplomacy, default to IQ+1).
    - Subtle trust-building (Savoir-Faire, Observation).
  - **Outcome**:
    - **Success**: Torrin reveals someone is framing him or points toward a suspicious crew member.
    - **Failure**: Torrin clams up, or lashes out, setting him on a path to mutiny.
    - **Ignored**: Torrin becomes a likely figurehead for rebellion.
- **Dialogue Prompts**:
    - Morgan: "You’ve got steel in your spine, Torrin. Don’t waste it being their pawn. Talk to me."
    - Torrin: "I’m no traitor. But if you think the danger’s over, you’re blind to the shadows on this deck."

### 🕵️ Background Suspicion – Calloway’s Thread
- **Subtle Clues**:
  - Whispers of “fair shares,” coded gestures, shifting loyalties.
  - Missing supplies, sabotaged lines, suspicious shipboard behavior.
- **Skill Checks**:
  - **Streetwise, Observation, Detect Lies, Savoir-Faire (High Society)**.
  - **Successful checks increment the Suspicion Meter** (hidden to players).
- **NPC Hints**:
  - “That old dog Torrin’s been talking in quiet corners lately.”
  - “Funny how that barrel vanished without a trace, eh?”

### 🎲 Suspicion Meter Mechanics
| Meter Level | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| 0–1 | Background unease; crew edgy but no solid evidence. |
| 2–3 | Strong hints of conspiracy; players can act early. |
| 4–5 | Mutiny erupts in Scene 4, catching players off guard. |
| **Torrin’s Role** | Determined by Morgan’s choices and rolls.|

### ⚙️ Scene Resolution
- **Players succeed**: Torrin swayed to loyalty; mutiny weakened or preempted.
- **Players fail/ignore**: Torrin either becomes a leader for the mutiny or a pawn, and the rebellion gains strength.
- **Transition to Scene 4**: The crisis escalates, and mutiny becomes inevitable or narrowly averted.

---

## GM Sidebar Notes
- Keep the mutiny’s undercurrents subtle but mounting.
- Reward player proactivity (Morgan’s engagement, Calloway’s observation).
- Torrin should feel like a real, conflicted person—not a one-note traitor or scapegoat.
- Build social tension naturally through NPC interactions and environmental cues.

---

## Summary
This scene brings the powder keg to the brink. The players are not passive—they shape who will stand with them or against them when the mutiny explodes in Scene 4.



---

## Scene 4: Mutiny Erupts

- **Setup:**  
  After tensions reach a boiling point, the mutiny erupts—likely during a quiet watch, or an opportune moment chosen by Torrin and the infiltrators.

- **Event details:**  
  - Shipboard combat: intense, brief, close-quarter fighting.  
  - Crew and players forced to defend key points of the ship—helm, captain's cabin, powder magazine.
  - Potential damage to sails, rigging, and hull from the skirmish.

- **Outcome:**  
  Mutiny suppressed after challenging fight. Torrin and key mutineers subdued, morale shaken, and ship damaged further.

---

## Scene 5: Diplomatic Encounter (The Iron Tide Greeting)

- **Setup:**  
  Shortly after the mutiny is settled, another Iron Tide vessel arrives—better armed, yet displaying diplomatic neutrality. They signal the Sojourner, clearly wanting to talk.

- **Event details:**  
  - Iron Tide captain comes aboard or arranges a parley under cautious, guarded conditions.  
  - They offer a deal: surviving mutineers (including Torrin) may peacefully transfer to Iron Tide custody in exchange for an uneasy truce.  
  - Conversation is filled with veiled threats and unsettling promises of future encounters.

- **Diplomatic Spotlight (Calloway):**  
  - Calloway carefully handles delicate negotiations, balancing pride, pragmatism, and crew safety.  
  - This scene emphasizes verbal sparring and subtle diplomatic manoeuvring rather than outright intimidation or force.

- **Crew reshuffle:**  
  - Mutineers transfer peacefully, reducing immediate threat.  
  - Lost crew numbers balanced out by merchant crew replacements from rescued survivors.

---
