# Adventure 6: "Uncharted Waters"

## Adventure Overview

Aldshore, a practical coastal settlement in the Kyngesreach Archipelago, is caught in escalating tensions between two influential local families: the shipwright Graysons and the navigator Arkwrights. Outsiders are initially distrusted, so the party must first build trust with various town factions through completing side quests. Only after gaining trust can they effectively mediate the feud and uncover deeper plots involving the Iron Tide pirates and rumours of the mysterious "Tidecaller Compass."
