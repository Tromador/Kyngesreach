# Adventure 6: "Uncharted Waters"


## Adventure Overview

Aldshore, a practical coastal settlement in the Kyngesreach Archipelago, is caught in escalating tensions between two influential local families: the shipwright Graysons and the navigator Arkwrights. Outsiders are initially distrusted, so the party must first build trust with various town factions through completing side quests. Only after gaining trust can they effectively mediate the feud and uncover deeper plots involving the Iron Tide pirates and rumours of the mysterious "Tidecaller Compass."

## Introduction - 🎙️ Captain Elias Godfrey – Quarterdeck Address (Opening of *Adventure 6: Uncharted Waters*)

*Setting: Early morning haze. Aldshore just breaking the horizon. Crew assembled, the *Sojourner* steady beneath them. Godfrey stands at the rail, voice quiet but carrying.*

> Crew of the *Sojourner*—listen close.  
>  
> We’ve spent the last week patching sails and watching shadows, and every man and woman aboard knows it’s been earned the hard way. What we faced out there wasn’t storm or shoal—it was the Iron Tide.  
>  
> They came sharp, fast, and proud. And we met them broadside, boarded, bled, and held the line. You kept your nerve when the powder burned. You saved lives. You proved this crew is more than hull and heading—it’s a damn blade in the sea.  
>  
> And now… a little luck.  
>  
> Word from our Iron Tide... acquaintance, has put us on course for Aldshore. A town still standing. Still welcoming. At least, for now. They say she’ll last the cycle. That’s long enough to breathe, if we’re careful.  
>  
> I’m not promising anything. But if there’s a tavern, I expect we’ll find it. If there’s ale, it’ll taste better on solid ground. And if the place has sense, they’ll trade drink for coin and ask fewer questions than we’ve had to answer lately.  
>  
> I won’t begrudge any of it. In fact, I expect it.  
>  
> You’ve earned the right to walk like your boots belong to you. To speak easy. To feel, just for an evening, that the world’s a little less broken than it’s looked lately.  
>  
> But remember what carries us—discipline, not indulgence. Respect the town, respect its people, and remember: when they see you, they see the *Sojourner*. Make that mean something.  
>  
> Look after your mates—have some dignity, and if the marines have to carry your sodden arse back on board, you’d best pray that I don’t hear about it.

---

### 🎙️ *Arrival at Aldshore* – Cinematic Read-Aloud

> The mist thins, sunlight spilling like stage light across the bay—and the town holds its breath.  
>  
> The town comes into focus in layers: salt-bleached rooftops, tar-streaked chimneys, lines of drying nets stretched like bunting across crooked streets. The harbour is alive with movement—crates hauled, fish gutted, ropes coiled. It’s a town used to mending what it can and doing without what it can’t.  
>  
> But then the bells start ringing. One, then two—not an alarm. A signal.  
>  
> And heads turn. Conversations falter. A fishwife pauses mid-gut, blade hovering. A child stops running, craning to see. On a rooftop, a rigger lowers his hammer, squinting toward the water.  
>  
> At first, it’s just a ship in the haze—broad of beam, low in the water, sails crisp and full. But then the brasswork catches light. The lines are clean, the rigging flawless. And from the stern, high and proud, a flag unfurls in the wind: **the Union of Principalities Naval Ensign**.

---

#### 🎬 *Shift to the Sojourner — full cinematic entrance*

> Out of the mist she comes—black hull flawless, sails taut and crisp, brasswork catching the sun like fire.  
> The *Sojourner*. A proper frigate, Union-built, naval blood in her bones.  
>  
> Her lines are clean, her motion precise. Crew stand taut at posts. Officers in smart coats move across the deck with unhurried efficiency. Signal flags flutter. Even the anchor gleams.  
>  
> Around her, the fishing fleet drifts like ghosts—sails patched with canvas and prayer, hulls held together with tar and time.

---

#### 🧍 *Back to shore — reactions build*

> “Gods preserve me…” someone whispers.  
> “That’s no merchantman.”  
> “Blue and Celeste? That’s the UPS ensign.”  
> “It’s active. That’s an active commission.”  
> “Here? What the hell is a navy ship doing *here*?”  
>  
> From balconies, shop doors, and the edge of the jetties, people spill out to watch. Children are hoisted onto shoulders. A barge captain lowers his hat. On a rooftop, a man grips the rail and doesn’t move, watching like he’s not sure whether to cheer or run.
>  
> A boy drops his pail, water splashing across the stones. A group of workers abandon a crate mid-lift just to gawk. On a balcony, someone raises a spyglass—and lowers it again, wordless.

---

#### 🎬 *Return to the Sojourner — final motion*

> The *Sojourner* cuts through the last of the mist like she’s parting a curtain.  
>  
> Her hull is dark, unmarred. Her rails gleam. The crew stand sharp at their posts, heads held high, eyes forward. Signal flags flutter their silent chorus.  
>  
> And from the quarterdeck, a commanding figure—**Godfrey**, coat perfectly buttoned, boots polished, eyes ahead—does not wave. He does not acknowledge. He simply *arrives*.

---

> The *Sojourner* glides in on a whisper of wind. Ropes cast, fenders deployed, sails trimmed in silence.  
> She kisses the dock like she’s done it a hundred times before.  
>  
> Not a shout. Not a scramble. Just discipline—clean and confident.  
>  
> From the shore, Aldshore watches her arrive like a **storm in uniform**: silent, sharp-edged, inevitable.  
>  
> The *Sojourner* does not anchor.  
> She **claims her berth**.


## ⚖️ Main Quest: Calming the Waters

**Goal:**  
Gain the trust of Aldshore’s two rival power groups—Graysons (shipwrights) and Arkwrights (navigators)—to resolve a leadership dispute that’s stalled trade and locked down vital information.

---

### 🎯 Why the Party Gets Involved

- The party arrives with **cargo to sell** (textiles, herbs from the *Morningstar*).
- They expect to offload it, resupply, and maybe gather information before Aldshore slips out of reach.
- But they find the docks in **practical gridlock**—vessels idle, manifests disputed, no one signing off.

> “We’ve got goods. They’ve got coin. But no one’s moving until someone breaks this standoff.”

### 🎙️ *Toller, Harbourmaster of Aldshore – Read-Aloud Introduction*

> A small knot of townsfolk has gathered on the dock, keeping a careful distance—close enough to gawk, far enough not to be mistaken for the welcoming committee.  
>  
> At the front stands a man in a battered oilskin coat and salt-flecked boots, clutching a leather-bound ledger like it might deflect cannon fire. He’s balding in a way that implies he gave up resisting years ago, and his expression suggests he’s already regretting *every* life choice that led to this moment.  
>  
> The crowd behind him whispers, nudges, and retreats by convenient degrees. No one else steps forward. This is clearly **his** job, whether he likes it or not.  

---

> As the gangplank drops and the first boots strike wood, he clears his throat, straightens his spine, and steps forward with the resigned dignity of a man addressing royalty in fish guts.  
>  
> “Right, well... welcome to Aldshore. You’ll be the, ah… Union ship.”  
>  
> *(He gestures vaguely at the Sojourner behind you.)*  
>  
> “Fine vessel. Very tidy. Very… large. I’m **Toller**. Harbourmaster, dockmaster, sometimes postmaster, and—” *(glances over his shoulder)* “—apparently head of the welcoming committee.”  
>  
> *(He cracks a polite, nervous smile.)*  
>  
> “We weren’t expecting visitors. Not… this sort, anyhow. Still, you’re here, you’ve made an entrance, and no one’s died, so I’d call that a strong start.”  
>  
> *(He fumbles with the ledger, flips a few pages, finds nothing useful, and snaps it shut.)*  
>  
> “So then. Who’s in charge?”


- Dockmaster Willem Toller makes it clear:
  - **No outsider trades** are being processed.
  - **Neither the Graysons nor Arkwrights** will authorise cargo clearance.
  - If the party wants to do business—or get real answers—they’ll need to make themselves useful.

> “Don’t care what flag you fly—if you want into Aldshore’s ledger, start by making some friends.”

---

### 🔥 Context: A Leadership Dispute

- The **Graysons** blame the **Arkwrights** for navigational misjudgements that caused damage, losses, and possibly sabotage.
- The **Arkwrights** accuse the **Graysons** of withholding repairs and stoking internal division.
- Both sides are **too proud to back down**, and too suspicious to cooperate.
- Outsiders are seen as **potential pawns**—but also as convenient neutral ground.

---

### 🧍‍♀️ Faction Positions

- **Rowena Arkwright**  
  - Analytical, respected, under pressure.  
  - Concerned about her missing nephew Merric, who vanished pursuing a theory about cycle behaviour.  
  - Suspects foul play—or external manipulation.

- **Eldric Grayson**  
  - Hard-bitten, proud, and no longer patient.  
  - Furious over missing tools and wrecked gear.  
  - Believes the Arkwrights are hiding something—or covering incompetence.

---

### 🧭 How the Party Gains Influence

The families don’t respond to talk—they respond to **proof**.  
Each side has real problems that aren’t being addressed because of the dispute.

By helping local citizens through **side quests**, the players build visible trust:

- “Lost at Sea” = community goodwill, stabilises dock morale.
- “The Quiet Dockhand” = earns Toller’s respect, exposes outside interference.
- “Missing Navigator” = breaks Arkwright silence.
- “Smuggler’s Rest” = restores Grayson standing and reveals shared enemy.

Once enough side quests are complete, the party has:
- **Trust to speak with both families**, and
- **Leverage to push them into dialogue**.

---

### 🤝 Resolution Scene

A final scene sees the players:
- Present what they’ve uncovered (Iron Tide signs, Merric’s message, sabotage details).
- Push for practical cooperation—**not peace, just function**.

They don’t make allies. They make **commerce and conversation possible again**.

---

### 🧾 Outcome:

- The docks reopen to Sojourner trade.  
- Rowena or Eldric share crucial information—about **cycles**, **Merric’s research**, and eventually the **Tidecaller Compass**.  
- Town returns to uneasy function just long enough for the players to get what they need.

**Note:** The crew can still enjoy tavern time throughout.  
This conflict doesn’t lock the town—it just **locks access to useful high-level answers and trade routes** until resolved.


---
### 🧿 Recurring Vosk Gag: "Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!"

Use these interludes between quests or scenes. Vosk must see the sahuagin first and deliver the exact same line every time. Players may intervene—pointlessly.

---

#### 🐟 Encounter 1: Fish Presentation

- The party is passing the docks.  
- Vosk drops a crate and stares toward the water.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- Two sahuagin rise waist-deep from the sea, one holding a **single fish** on a polished plank.  
- They gently **tilt the plank toward Vosk**, nod, and submerge.

---

#### 🐚 Encounter 2: Tavern Visitation

- Inside the tavern, mid-meal.  
- The door creaks open. Two dripping sahuagin step inside.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- One walks up to Vosk and solemnly **places a seashell** on his table.  
- They bow to the room and leave. No one else reacts.

---

#### 🌙 Encounter 3: Moonlit Chase

- Party sees Vosk **sprinting past them** at night.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- A single sahuagin is walking calmly down the street behind him, holding a **small lantern made of coral**.  
- It does not speed up. It does not stop. It just watches.

---

#### 🪢 Encounter 4: Dockside Knotwork

- PCs spot Vosk arguing with a rope vendor.  
- Behind him, a sahuagin silently **ties a knot** in a coil of spare rope.  
- The knot resembles a spiral.  
> Vosk turns, freezes. “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- The sahuagin gives him a **thumbs-up**, then steps backward off the dock into the water.

---

#### 🪦 Encounter 5: Shell Arrangement

- Party returns to the ship and finds **spiral shell patterns** arranged neatly on the deck near Vosk’s hammock.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- He points at them, panic rising.  
- There are no sahuagin in sight—until one **slowly surfaces**, salutes, and sinks again without a word.

---

#### 🎶 Encounter 6: Choral Murmurs

- While crossing town, the PCs hear **strange harmonic humming** echoing through an alley.  
- Vosk is backing out slowly.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- Three sahuagin are standing in perfect unison, making low melodic clicks.  
- One produces a **tiny harp made of fishbone**, strums a note, and walks away.

---

## 🐟 The Sahuagin Wedding of Larman Vosk

**Trigger:**  
This event occurs after the final side quest and before or during the “Imminent Cycle” main event. It should interrupt something important.

---

### 🎬 Setting:

- **Location:** Low stone quay outside Aldshore.  
- **Time:** High tide. Full moon.  
- **Atmosphere:** The sea is glass-calm. The sky is cloudless. The air carries a faint tang of brine and ceremony.

---

### 🎭 The Procession:

- Ten sahuagin emerge from the sea in ritual formation.
- Each wears robes of woven kelp, crusted coral, and faded linen banners with spiral glyphs.
- A slow, solemn music plays—reef-horns and hollow bone flutes in an unsettlingly irregular rhythm.
- They carry no weapons. Only tradition.

---

### 🎩 The Ceremonial Hat:

- Towering, ridiculous, and reverent.  
- Constructed from lacquered crab shells.  
- Fan coral antlers reach a metre wide, each dangling with live sea anemones.  
- Salt-rimed netting trails over the face like a bridal veil, embedded with glass shards, fishbone, and a whole barnacled clam.  
- From the crown dangles a driftwood plank etched in curling runes:
  - *“Tide Claimed. Moon Witnessed. He is Taken.”*
- The entire structure makes a quiet **gurgling** noise when worn, like a sponge thinking hard.

---

### 👰🏾 The Ceremony:

- Vosk tries to flee. Two sahuagin step calmly to either side and wait. He freezes.
- The music rises.
- A pair of attendants place the hat on his head. It *sinks slightly*, as if tasting him.
- The High Priestess raises her kelp-wrapped staff.

She chants for several minutes—tones and clicks that have never been heard above water.

Then, with slow solemnity, she taps Vosk **twice on the chest** with the staff.

> **High Priestess Nalqua (translated, if attempted):**  
> “The debt is satisfied. The reef releases its claim.”

And just like that—  
They turn.  
And return to the sea.

---

### 🧘 Aftermath:

- Vosk is left standing alone.
- The hat remains. The music stops. The tide begins to recede.
- No one speaks. Even the gulls are silent.
- Only the faint **gurgle** of ceremonial dampness can be heard from the hat.

The sahuagin do not return.

---

### 🎭 Final Epilogue (End of Session):

- The party finds Vosk later, sitting at the edge of the quay.
- He is still wearing the hat.

If approached:

> **Vosk (softly):**  
> “Oh no... they’re gone.”  
> *(pause)*  
> “...I think I miss them.”

---

### 🪖 Post-Wedding Vosk Behaviour Protocol (Epilogue)

- Vosk **wears the hat at all times**. It does not slip. It does not tilt. It is *resolute*.
- When asked about it, he responds with total sincerity:

> **Vosk:**  
> “What hat?”

- The hat emits occasional, unpredictable sounds:
  - *flobber*
  - *drup*
  - *klik-kloonk*
  - *grallll*
  - *glurb*
  - *enthusiastic bubbling*

- If a player attempts to remove it:
  - The moment their fingers touch it, it emits a defensive *squelch* and goes slightly warm.
  - A **gentle but unrelenting suction** holds it in place.
  - Strength rolls accomplish nothing. Magic slides off like oil on kelp.

> **Optional GM Response (if they persist):**  
> “You feel an ancient and unspoken pressure, as though a billion solemn fish are watching, disappointed.”

- If Detect Magic or similar is used:
  - The hat lights up like a beacon. Schools of nearby fish immediately change direction.
  - Interpretation attempts yield only:
    - “Conjuration.”  
    - “Binding.”  
    - And “Possibly ceremonial etiquette enforcement.”

**Note:**  
Under no circumstances is this hat to be stolen, removed, or repurposed. It is not loot. It is **a burden**.  
One Vosk must carry.  
With honour.  
And *glurb*.




## Side Quests (Reputation Building)

### 🧭 Side Quest 1: "Lost at Sea"

**Objective:**  
Rescue fisherman Arlen Mallen, missing near the Raven’s Teeth—against all better judgement.

---

**Hook / Discovery:**

At the fishmarket, the party overhears a tense exchange. Kira Mallen is confronting Harbourmaster Willem Toller, her voice sharp with grief and anger.

### 🎙️ *Kira and Toller’s Argument – Read-Aloud Narrative*

> The salty air of the fishmarket is thick with gull cries and the slap of nets—until it’s pierced by a voice sharp with fury.  

> **Kira Mallen**—fisherwoman, shoulders square, fists clenched—stands toe-to-toe with **Harbourmaster Toller**. Her voice cuts through the bustle like a gutting blade.

> **Kira (furious):**  
> “Don’t feed me tales of tides and curses. He said he was laying tribute nets—not heading into the Teeth! And now you say no one’s seen him? Then *someone* should be out there looking!”

> **Toller (trying to keep calm):**  
> “If he’s out past the black rock, it’s his own damn fault. You know as well as I do—Raven’s Teeth don’t let go.”

> A few heads turn. Voices lower. You get the sense that this isn’t the first time Kira has fought this fight—and that Toller’s patience is starting to fray, too.

---

> If the players approach or intervene, Kira rounds on them without hesitation, eyes fierce and tired.

> **Kira (quick, but quieting):**  
> “He lied. Or maybe he thought I’d stop him. Either way, he’s out there—and if he’s not dead, he’s clinging to something that won’t last the tide.”

Kira knows:

- Arlen’s nephew drowned in the Teeth during the last cycle.
- Arlen has quietly returned each year to lay tribute nets in his memory.
- This year, he promised Kira he wouldn’t go. Now he’s missing.
- His small boat was last seen heading southeast. Weather is worsening.
---

> Toller exhales, looks at the sky like it might give him a better answer, then mutters:

> **Toller (grim):**  
> “You’ll need a cutter. Small enough to thread the reef. And a damn sight more luck than sense.”

> He scratches the back of his neck, eyeing the party.

> “You lot brought a navy ship through the mist. Maybe you’re just reckless enough to try.”

---

**Setting: Raven’s Teeth**

- Jagged rock formation southeast of Aldshore.
- Sharp reefs and unpredictable currents.
- Locals avoid it—said to be cursed or unstable.
- Tides here change rapidly, with minimal warning.

---

**Approach & Travel:**

- Players must borrow or hire a vessel (small skiff or local cutter).
- Navigation, Boating, and Observation rolls required.
- Encourage teamwork: one navigates, one watches for hazards, one manages sails/rigging.

**Key Skill Challenges:**

- **Navigation (or Cartography):** Chart safe approach route.  
- **Boating (Sailing):** Handle shifting tides, avoid hull damage.  
- **Observation / Perception:** Spot signs of wreckage, gulls, netting, or movement.  
- **Weather Sense (optional):** Read if another tidal shift is imminent.

---

**Encounter:**

### 🌊 *Approach to the Raven’s Teeth – Read-Aloud Narrative*

> The sea grows quieter as you near the reef—but it’s not a peaceful silence.  
> It’s the kind that holds its breath.  
>  
> The Raven’s Teeth rise from the water like the spine of some drowned leviathan—jagged black rocks slick with tide and age.  
>  
> The waves here don’t crash. They *twist*. Currents snag unexpectedly. More than once, the skiff yaws, rudder biting wrong despite the tiller.  
>  
> Even the gulls keep their distance.

---

> Navigation becomes guesswork. Every channel looks like the last.  
> Strange eddies swirl where the charts say open water.  
> And the tide shifts without warning—rising or falling in erratic pulses that make no sense.

> A sudden cry—someone spots **netting**, draped across a narrow gully between two reef spines.  
>  
> As the boat edges closer, you see the shape of a small skiff—wedged hard into a natural gully, its hull cracked and half-swamped.  
>  
> A figure slumps in the prow, tangled in line, burned red by sun and salt.  
>  
> **Arlen.**

- Arlen’s skiff is wedged in a gully between rock spines, cracked but afloat.
- Arlen is barely conscious, sunburnt, and badly dehydrated.
- His net is still out—full of silver fish. Unnatural catch density may feel eerie.

> **Arlen (weakly):**  
> “The fish… they were waiting. Never seen the sea offer so much. I—I thought maybe it was a gift. For him.”

**Rescue Tasks:**

- **Swimming / Climbing / Acrobatics:** Reach Arlen without capsizing.  
- **First Aid or Survival:** Stabilise him before movement.  
- **Rope Use / Coordination:** Haul both man and gear back to vessel.  
- **Teamwork Bonus:** Reduce penalties if roles are well divided.

---

**Return & Outcome:**

- Arlen survives but is weak; deeply shaken by the experience.
- Kira embraces him, then slaps him, then cries.

> **Kira (to PCs):**  
> “You brought him back. That’s more than I thought I’d see again. I owe you.”

- Harbourmaster Toller acknowledges the rescue with quiet respect.  
- Fisherfolk begin treating the party as trustworthy outsiders.

---

**Rewards & Reputation:**

- Minor token from Kira (e.g. charm, family keepsake).  
- Possible fresh fish supplies if requested.  
- +1 **Faction Trust: Fisherfolk**  
- **Toller’s stance shifts to neutral or cautious ally.**

---

**Foreshadowing (optional):**

If desired, Arlen can mention subtle oddities:

> **Arlen (murmuring):**  
> “The tide… it turned *wrong*. Like the sea was waiting for something. I know those rocks. They weren’t where they should be.”

This lays groundwork for Tidecaller Compass-related anomalies without dominating the moment.

---

### ⚓ Side Quest 2: "The Quiet Dockhand"

**Objective:**  
Discover why dockhand Finn is behaving strangely and resolve the blackmail situation discreetly.

---

**Hook / Discovery:**

While moving cargo or speaking with Willem Toller at the harbour, the party notices one of the younger dockhands—**Finn**—flinching, distracted, and nervously scanning the crowds.

> **Toller (if asked):**  
> “Finn’s been off lately. Jumpier than a cat in a storm hold. Still works hard, but something’s wrong. Doesn’t say a word about it.”

A quick Observation or Human Behaviour check reveals Finn:
- Avoids eye contact with authority.
- Visibly reacts when a certain sailor or warehouse worker passes by.
- Slips away during breaks to the far end of the docks.

---

**NPCs & Relationships:**

- **Finn** – Young dockhand, anxious, not streetwise. Wants to escape his situation but doesn’t know how.
- **Willem Toller** – Harbourmaster. Fair-minded, not cruel. Will support the PCs’ handling if it’s clean and doesn’t embarrass him.
- **Clem Vatcher** – The blackmailer. A mid-level Iron Tide informant posing as a petty cargo handler. Greedy, arrogant, subtle.

---

**Investigation Phase (Brief):**

Following Finn discreetly leads to:
- Him meeting Clem in a shadowed corner behind warehouse #3.
- Clem quietly **threatening to expose something** unless Finn keeps “finding space” in the manifests.

If players confront Finn directly:
> **Finn (panicked):**  
> “I didn’t know who they were at first—I swear. Just said move crates, fudge the log. Then they said if I told anyone—if I *even looked wrong*—they’d drown me in the dark.”

He won’t give up Clem’s name without reassurance or social pressure.

---

**Confrontation Options:**

The party can now resolve the issue by choosing one of several methods:

1. **Diplomacy / Persuasion:**
   - Approach Clem discreetly. Offer a bribe, threaten exposure, or broker Finn’s withdrawal.
   - Clem backs down if he thinks the Harbourmaster is watching.

2. **Intimidation:**
   - Corner Clem alone. A short, direct warning such as:
> “Bad idea threatening dockhands while we’re in town. Makes us take an interest we wouldn’t otherwise have.”

3. **Stealth / Subterfuge:**
   - Catch Clem red-handed slipping Iron Tide markings or false cargo onto a manifest.
   - Present this to Toller or threaten to expose it.

---

**Outcome & Resolution:**

- Clem flees town or goes quiet, depending on approach.
- Finn is grateful, shaken, and returns to work with renewed focus.
- Toller quietly pulls the party aside:

> **Toller:**  
> “Don’t know what you did. Don’t want to know. But Finn’s back on his feet, and my docks are quieter for it. You’ve got my eye—and my thanks.”

---

**Rewards & Reputation:**

- Quiet respect from Willem Toller.  
- Trust among the **dockworkers**.  
- Access to restricted dock areas or faster port operations later if relevant.  
- +1 **Faction Trust: Dockworkers / Harbourmaster**

---

**Optional Clue:**

If players dig or question Clem:
- He mutters something about “the Tide having eyes everywhere.”
- A crate nearby bears the spiral marking seen in previous Stormcaller dealings—hastily scratched off.

> **Clem (bitterly):**  
> “Tell your captain this port won’t last the cycle. You’re just renting time.”

---

### 🧭 Side Quest 3: "Missing Navigator"

**Objective:**  
Investigate the mysterious disappearance of Merric Halden, a respected Arkwright navigator—last seen behaving strangely, then vanishing without explanation.

### 🧭 *Toller Approaches the Players – Read-Aloud Narrative*

> Toller finds you later in the morning—hat in hand, expression unreadable, voice pitched lower than usual.  

> **Toller (quietly):**  
> “Right. So. This might be a bit delicate.”  
>  
> *(He scratches behind his ear, choosing words like they might explode.)*  
>  
> “Rowena Arkwright’s asked for a word. Personally.”  
>  
> *(He holds up a hand before anyone can reply.)*  
>  
> “Not an order. Not a summons. Just… an invitation. She’s heard you’ve been helping folk, and she’s got a concern she doesn’t trust to half the town.”  
>  
> *(Beat.)*  
>  
> “If you’re looking to help fix what’s broken at the docks… this wouldn’t be a bad place to start.”

> *(He gives a shrug that’s somewhere between encouragement and resignation.)*  
>  
> “Her office is on the bluff, above the inner quay. Don’t be late. She hates late.”

---

**Hook / Initial Contact:**

After gaining some local trust, the party is granted an audience with **Rowena Arkwright**, who remains reserved but practical. She sets them a task:

### 🎙️ *Meeting Rowena Arkwright*

> The Arkwright office is quiet, precise, and expensive. Nautical tools rest like artifacts in lacquered inlays. A half-drawn tide map glows faintly under oil-lamp light.  
>  
> **Rowena Arkwright** stands by the window overlooking the quay, hands clasped behind her back. She speaks before turning.

> **Rowena:**  
> “I don’t waste time with strangers. But I’ve been told you’re not just passing through. That you’ve helped. Listened.”  
>  
> *(She finally turns to face you—expression unreadable.)*  
>  
> “So I’ll be plain. My nephew, **Merric Halden**, is missing. No word. No sign.  
> He was working charts… not mine. His own.”  
>  
> *(She gestures to a bundle on her desk.)*  
>  
> “If you care about Aldshore—and you *should*, if you want those docks to open again—then help me understand what happened.  
>  
> His cottage is just outside town. You’ll want to speak to Serena.”

> *(She says no more. The charts rustle in the silence, as if still shifting on their own.)*


---

**Key NPCs:**

- **Rowena Arkwright** – Navigator matriarch. Allows the party to investigate, reluctantly.  
- **Serena Halden** – Merric’s wife. Kind but exhausted. She knew he was anxious about the coming cycle, but didn’t expect him to act without telling her.  
- **Dockworkers & neighbours** – Some saw signs of Merric preparing to slip away.

---

**Investigation Phase (Brief):**

The players visit **Merric’s cottage**. Serena is present and cooperative if treated gently. She gives them access to Merric’s notes and workspace.

Key Discoveries:

1. **Private notes and charts** (Navigation or Occultism check to interpret):
   - Detailed attempts to **predict cycle timing**, with annotations like:
     > *“Pattern not holding. Drift compression increasing.”*  
     > *“This place will shift soon. Must be beyond sight when it happens.”*

2. **A folded letter with no signature**, suggesting:
   - A rendezvous “beyond the southern bluff.”
   - Reference to “an alternate route out—not by map, but by timing.”
   - Iron Tide seal on letter

3. **Marked chart** showing a cove near **Smuggler’s Rest**, annotated:
   > *“Wait for third pull of the ebb. Passage only holds at slack.”*

A **dockhand** (with minimal persuasion) admits Merric left in the early hours, travelling light, “like he had something to prove.”

---

**Lore Clarification:**

- Everyone in Aldshore knows **cycle shifts** are real—ships that vanish, islands that move, routes that don’t stay fixed.
- That’s why **inshore navigation is standard practice**, especially when signs point to an imminent shift.
- Merric’s actions were reckless *because* he stopped following those norms. He believed he could **escape the timing** if he understood it deeply enough.

This puts the first concrete question in the party’s hands:
> “Can the cycles be predicted? Or even outrun?”

---

**Outcome & Reward:**

- The party earns **Rowena’s cautious respect**—they’ve shown discretion and competence.
- Serena quietly thanks them, but worries the truth won’t be something she wants to hear.
- The cove near **Smuggler’s Rest** becomes the next destination.

### 🛶 Side Quest 4: "Smuggler’s Rest"

**Objective:**  
Track down Merric Halden’s last known location at a remote cove, recover stolen Grayson shipwright tools, and confront Iron Tide agents operating near Aldshore.

---

**Setup:**

Using Merric’s marked charts and notes from *“Missing Navigator”*, the party sails or hikes to a narrow cove south of Aldshore—known locally as **Smuggler’s Rest**.

It’s a half-forgotten inlet used by fringe traders, castoffs, and sometimes worse. Locals avoid it—especially near a cycle change.

---

**Key NPCs:**

- **Merric Halden** – The missing navigator. Found held under loose guard in a tide-carved shelter. He’s unharmed, but rattled and sleepless.  
- **Quinn Darrow** – Iron Tide scout leader. Smooth, mercenary, not fanatical. Prefers advantage to bloodshed.  
- **Two Iron Tide operatives** – Alert, lightly armed. Will escalate only if provoked.

---

**The Encounter:**

The players find a **makeshift Iron Tide camp**, hidden under a jutting bluff above the cove. A skiff is tethered offshore. Crates nearby bear Grayson marking stamps—some pried off, others half-burned.

**Merric is alive**, inside a shelter, speaking calmly with Quinn when the party arrives.

The players can approach in several ways:

---

### 🗣️ Resolution Options:

**1. Stealth & Overwhelm**  
- Players ambush the camp. Fight is short and sharp.
- Merric survives but is shaken. Some tools may be damaged.

**2. Parley / Negotiation**  
- Quinn is open to a deal:
  - Let them go with one crate (tools or a decoy),
  - And they leave Merric and the rest untouched.
  - Or: small bribe, misinformation, or bluff can turn the encounter.

> **Quinn (casually):**  
> “This place won’t last the season. We’re just looking for leverage—he had theories. You want him, take him. But be quick about it.”

**3. Deception**  
- Players pretend to be neutral smugglers or Tide sympathisers.
- Can extract Merric and slip away without combat.

---

### 🧠 Lore Unlock (from Merric or Quinn):  

#### What Merric reveals:

> “I thought it was just drift theory, but the patterns held. Ships moving *before* the change. Navigating through it. That’s not luck. That’s something else.  
> They found me just as I was getting close. I think… I think they don’t want people knowing the timing can be *beaten*.”

He doesn’t know what a **Tidecaller Compass** is—but he knows someone is navigating cycles on purpose. And it scared him.

#### What Quinn might say, if pressured:

> “He wasn’t a threat. Just inconvenient. Some knowledge ought to stay proprietary.”

---

### 🧾 Outcome:

- Merric is returned to Rowena, who is quietly stunned—and grateful.
- The stolen **Grayson tools** are recovered intact or mostly intact.
- If players handled it without bloodshed, both sides remark on their restraint and competence.

---

**Faction Trust:**
- **Arkwright Family +1** (rescuing Merric)
- **Grayson Family +1** (returning tools)

---

**Unlocks:**
- **Main quest resolution now possible**: both factions will talk.
- **Tidecaller Compass** is now a concrete lead—not named, but strongly implied.

### 🧓 Optional Encounter: "The Old Salt’s Tale"

**Objective:**  
Listen to Old Gideon’s strange recollection of a past sea encounter—part ghost story, part warning. A roleplay-focused reward for perceptive or respectful players.

---

**Setting:**  
- **Location:** The Bent Gull tavern, late evening.  
- **Time:** After at least one major side quest has been completed.  
- **Atmosphere:** Dim oil-lanterns, quiet fiddle music, salt and smoke in the air.  
- **NPCs clear the room** subtly as Gideon begins his tale.

---

**NPC: Old Gideon**

- Retired sailor. Widower. Missing two fingers and most of his sense of timing.
- Drinks hard but speaks clearly when sober—or when the story hits a rhythm.
- Doesn’t boast. Doesn’t lie. What he saw, he believes.

---

**Trigger:**

The players buy him a drink, ask about strange tides, or mention **cycle shifts** near the end of the session.

---

**Gideon’s Tale (spoken slowly, softly):**

> “We was off the chain reef, near Kessler’s Drift. Sky was wrong—stars slid like oil.  
>  
> Thought we’d sailed through a fogbank, but the sea was glass. Not calm—*waiting*.  
>  
> Then she came. A ship. Sleek. No rigging, no flag, no wake. Just there.  
>  
> A man stood on the prow. Or a woman. Hard to say. Robes like tide foam. Skin… grey? Blue? Changed when you looked away.  
>  
> They lifted a rod. Not a compass, not a wand. Just a length of stone and coral.  
>  
> And the sea obeyed it.”  
>
> *(long pause)*  
>
> “Tide turned against the wind. Our lookout screamed, then vanished.  
> The crew panicked. We ran. Only three made it back.  
>  
> I still don’t know what I saw. But I heard the name, once.  
>  
> *Stormcallers.*”  
>
> *(long drink)*  
>  
> “If they still walk the water, I want no part of them. But if you're the curious sort... ask your compass which way is *wrong*.”

---

**Optional Skill Use:**

- **Insight / Psychology:** Gideon believes every word. His voice falters when describing the ship—there’s fear behind the story.
- **Occultism / Hidden Lore:** The description of the “rod” closely matches elements in Merric’s cycle sketches—but weaponised.

---

**Outcome / Reward:**

- Adds rich atmosphere and foreshadowing.
- Confirms the Stormcallers exist, or once did.
- Links the term **Tidecaller Compass** with an act of direct environmental control—not just passive sensing.

**No mechanical benefit. But the players will remember it.**

---

**Optional Follow-up:**

> **Tavernkeeper (muttering after Gideon leaves):**  
> “He only tells that story when the sea’s about to change. Never twice in one cycle.”

---


## Final Quest: "Imminent Cycle Decision"

**Objective:**  
Make a crucial decision when signs of an impending cycle threaten Aldshore’s stability.

**Encounter:**  
- Players observe clear cycle signals (strange tides, animal behaviours, weather)  
- Town turns to players for guidance; choose to stay or urgently depart

**Choices and Consequences:**  
- Departing to safety guarantees survival but potentially damages relations with Aldshore  
- Staying through the cycle secures full Aldshore trust but involves unknown risks

**Additional Stakes:**  
- Emotional NPC appeals (e.g., Serena Halden, Kira Mallen) seeking passage or safety

|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Early tavern/local scenes         | Dockworkers, Kira, Toller   | “Aldshore’s safe *this* cycle.” / “Stick to inshore routes. Don’t risk a shift.”                 | Casual superstition            |
| During “Missing Navigator”        | Serena, notes, Rowena       | Merric believed the **cycles could be predicted**. Thought he could find a way to “step out.”     | Emotional concern / suspicion  |
| Mid-investigation notes           | Merric’s charts             | Diagrams and notations that suggest **non-random pattern detection**                             | Navigation skill/occultism     |
| “Smuggler’s Rest” (camp found)    | Quinn Darrow or Merric      | Iron Tide **uses something** to predict or survive cycles. Merric noticed this.                  | Verbal interrogation           |
| “Smuggler’s Rest” (Merric reveals)| Merric Halden               | “They didn’t want me to talk. They’re *using* something. A device. It stabilises the route.”     | Nervous, but lucid             |
| If players push further           | Merric (follow-up)          | “They didn’t make it. The **Stormcallers** did. That’s the name I heard. A cult—or a sect.”       | Quiet drop, first naming       |
| Optional item find (camp loot)    | Iron Tide crate or mapcase  | Labelled “S.C. Driftlock—return to Coilbase before tide shift.”                                  | Physical clue                  |
| Post-resolution debrief (optional)| Toller, Rowena (if asked)   | “Stormcallers... I’ve heard the name. Always just before trouble. Always near a shift.”          | Suspicious, but indirect       |

---

**GM Notes:**

- The **name “Stormcaller”** should drop **once only**—preferably from Merric, in a moment of low-key delivery.
- The **players should realise its weight** through context, not exposition. Merric knows they’re real. Rowena suspects. Quinn doesn’t care—he just uses their tools.
- Later adventures will deepen this: the cult’s purpose, methods, and origin can unfold slowly.

---

**Pacing Suggestion:**

Don’t confirm everything. Drop the pieces. Let players start the theorising.

## Pitch to Players (Video-Game Style):

> "You've arrived at Aldshore, a port town deeply suspicious of outsiders. To mediate the bitter rivalry between the Graysons and the Arkwrights, you'll first need to gain the locals’ trust by completing quests around town. Consider them classic RPG-style side quests: rescuing fishermen, resolving dockside intrigues, and investigating mysterious disappearances. Prove yourselves trustworthy, unravel hidden plots involving Iron Tide pirates and the enigmatic Tidecaller Compass, and ultimately guide Aldshore through an imminent, unpredictable cycle."

---


## GM Tips & Tone:

- Clearly track trust-building progress visibly for players.
- Roleplay NPC interactions to heighten emotional stakes.
- Emphasize moral ambiguity and player-driven decisions.
- Maintain a video-game RPG tone familiar and appealing to players.

This structured, RPG-inspired adventure format should be easy to reference during play, providing a clear progression and plenty of immersive roleplaying opportunities.
