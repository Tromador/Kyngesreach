# Adventure 6: "Uncharted Waters"


## Adventure Overview

Aldshore, a practical coastal settlement in the Kyngesreach Archipelago, is caught in escalating tensions between two influential local families: the shipwright Graysons and the navigator Arkwrights. Outsiders are initially distrusted, so the party must first build trust with various town factions through completing side quests. Only after gaining trust can they effectively mediate the feud and uncover deeper plots involving the Iron Tide pirates and rumours of the mysterious "Tidecaller Compass."

## Introduction - 🎙️ Captain Elias Godfrey – Quarterdeck Address (Opening of *Adventure 6: Uncharted Waters*)

*Setting: Early morning haze. Aldshore just breaking the horizon. Crew assembled, the *Sojourner* steady beneath them. Godfrey stands at the rail, voice quiet but carrying.*

> Crew of the *Sojourner*—listen close.  
>  
> We’ve spent the last week patching sails and watching shadows, and every man and woman aboard knows it’s been earned the hard way. What we faced out there wasn’t storm or shoal—it was the Iron Tide.  
>  
> They came sharp, fast, and proud. And we met them broadside, boarded, bled, and held the line. You kept your nerve when the powder burned. You saved lives. You proved this crew is more than hull and heading—it’s a damn blade in the sea.  
>  
> And now… a little luck.  
>  
> Word from our Iron Tide... acquaintance, has put us on course for Aldshore. A town still standing. Still welcoming. At least, for now. They say she’ll last the cycle. That’s long enough to breathe, if we’re careful.  
>  
> I’m not promising anything. But if there’s a tavern, I expect we’ll find it. If there’s ale, it’ll taste better on solid ground. And if the place has sense, they’ll trade drink for coin and ask fewer questions than we’ve had to answer lately.  
>  
> I won’t begrudge any of it. In fact, I expect it.  
>  
> You’ve earned the right to walk like your boots belong to you. To speak easy. To feel, just for an evening, that the world’s a little less broken than it’s looked lately.  
>  
> But remember what carries us—discipline, not indulgence. Respect the town, respect its people, and remember: when they see you, they see the *Sojourner*. Make that mean something.  
>  
> Look after your mates—have some dignity, and if the marines have to carry your sodden arse back on board, you’d best pray that I don’t hear about it.

Mediate and resolve the dispute between Eldric Grayson (Shipwrights) and Rowena Arkwright (Navigators), ultimately uncovering Iron Tide interference and the truth behind the missing navigator, Merric Halden.

Initially, both families distrust the players. Trust must be earned by completing side quests.

**Final Outcome:**  
Successful mediation leads to unified Aldshore support and insights about the cycles, the Iron Tide, and the Tidecaller Compass.

### 🧿 Recurring Vosk Gag: "Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!"

Use these interludes between quests or scenes. Vosk must see the sahuagin first and deliver the exact same line every time. Players may intervene—pointlessly.

---

#### 🐟 Encounter 1: Fish Presentation

- The party is passing the docks.  
- Vosk drops a crate and stares toward the water.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- Two sahuagin rise waist-deep from the sea, one holding a **single fish** on a polished plank.  
- They gently **tilt the plank toward Vosk**, nod, and submerge.

---

#### 🐚 Encounter 2: Tavern Visitation

- Inside the tavern, mid-meal.  
- The door creaks open. Two dripping sahuagin step inside.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- One walks up to Vosk and solemnly **places a seashell** on his table.  
- They bow to the room and leave. No one else reacts.

---

#### 🌙 Encounter 3: Moonlit Chase

- Party sees Vosk **sprinting past them** at night.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- A single sahuagin is walking calmly down the street behind him, holding a **small lantern made of coral**.  
- It does not speed up. It does not stop. It just watches.

---

#### 🪢 Encounter 4: Dockside Knotwork

- PCs spot Vosk arguing with a rope vendor.  
- Behind him, a sahuagin silently **ties a knot** in a coil of spare rope.  
- The knot resembles a spiral.  
> Vosk turns, freezes. “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- The sahuagin gives him a **thumbs-up**, then steps backward off the dock into the water.

---

#### 🪦 Encounter 5: Shell Arrangement

- Party returns to the ship and finds **spiral shell patterns** arranged neatly on the deck near Vosk’s hammock.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- He points at them, panic rising.  
- There are no sahuagin in sight—until one **slowly surfaces**, salutes, and sinks again without a word.

## 🎶 Encounter 6: Choral Murmurs

- While crossing town, the PCs hear **strange harmonic humming** echoing through an alley.  
- Vosk is backing out slowly.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- Three sahuagin are standing in perfect unison, making low melodic clicks.  
- One produces a **tiny harp made of fishbone**, strums a note, and walks away.

## 🐟 The Sahuagin Wedding of Larman Vosk

**Trigger:**  
This event occurs after the final side quest and before or during the “Imminent Cycle” main event. It should interrupt something important.

---

### 🎬 Setting:

- **Location:** Low stone quay outside Aldshore.  
- **Time:** High tide. Full moon.  
- **Atmosphere:** The sea is glass-calm. The sky is cloudless. The air carries a faint tang of brine and ceremony.

---

### 🎭 The Procession:

- Ten sahuagin emerge from the sea in ritual formation.
- Each wears robes of woven kelp, crusted coral, and faded linen banners with spiral glyphs.
- A slow, solemn music plays—reef-horns and hollow bone flutes in an unsettlingly irregular rhythm.
- They carry no weapons. Only tradition.

---

### 🎩 The Ceremonial Hat:

- Towering, ridiculous, and reverent.  
- Constructed from lacquered crab shells.  
- Fan coral antlers reach a metre wide, each dangling with live sea anemones.  
- Salt-rimed netting trails over the face like a bridal veil, embedded with glass shards, fishbone, and a whole barnacled clam.  
- From the crown dangles a driftwood plank etched in curling runes:
  - *“Tide Claimed. Moon Witnessed. He is Taken.”*
- The entire structure makes a quiet **gurgling** noise when worn, like a sponge thinking hard.

---

### 👰🏾 The Ceremony:

- Vosk tries to flee. Two sahuagin step calmly to either side and wait. He freezes.
- The music rises.
- A pair of attendants place the hat on his head. It *sinks slightly*, as if tasting him.
- The High Priestess raises her kelp-wrapped staff.

She chants for several minutes—tones and clicks that have never been heard above water.

Then, with slow solemnity, she taps Vosk **twice on the chest** with the staff.

> **High Priestess Nalqua (translated, if attempted):**  
> “The debt is satisfied. The reef releases its claim.”

And just like that—  
They turn.  
And return to the sea.

---

### 🧘 Aftermath:

- Vosk is left standing alone.
- The hat remains. The music stops. The tide begins to recede.
- No one speaks. Even the gulls are silent.
- Only the faint **gurgle** of ceremonial dampness can be heard from the hat.

The sahuagin do not return.

---

### 🎭 Final Epilogue (End of Session):

- The party finds Vosk later, sitting at the edge of the quay.
- He is still wearing the hat.

If approached:

> **Vosk (softly):**  
> “Oh no... they’re gone.”  
> *(pause)*  
> “...I think I miss them.”

---

### 🪖 Post-Wedding Vosk Behaviour Protocol (Epilogue)

- Vosk **wears the hat at all times**. It does not slip. It does not tilt. It is *resolute*.
- When asked about it, he responds with total sincerity:

> **Vosk:**  
> “What hat?”

- The hat emits occasional, unpredictable sounds:
  - *flobber*
  - *drup*
  - *klik-kloonk*
  - *grallll*
  - *glurb*
  - *enthusiastic bubbling*

- If a player attempts to remove it:
  - The moment their fingers touch it, it emits a defensive *squelch* and goes slightly warm.
  - A **gentle but unrelenting suction** holds it in place.
  - Strength rolls accomplish nothing. Magic slides off like oil on kelp.

> **Optional GM Response (if they persist):**  
> “You feel an ancient and unspoken pressure, as though a billion solemn fish are watching, disappointed.”

- If Detect Magic or similar is used:
  - The hat lights up like a beacon. Schools of nearby fish immediately change direction.
  - Interpretation attempts yield only:
    - “Conjuration.”  
    - “Binding.”  
    - And “Possibly ceremonial etiquette enforcement.”

**Note:**  
Under no circumstances is this hat to be stolen, removed, or repurposed. It is not loot. It is **a burden**.  
One Vosk must carry.  
With honour.  
And *glurb*.




## Side Quests (Reputation Building)

### 🧭 Side Quest 1: "Lost at Sea"

**Objective:**  
Rescue fisherman Arlen Mallen, missing near the Raven’s Teeth—against all better judgement.

---

**Hook / Discovery:**

At the fishmarket, the party overhears a tense exchange. Kira Mallen is confronting Harbourmaster Willem Toller, her voice sharp with grief and anger.

> **Kira Mallen (to Toller):**  
> “Don’t feed me tales of tides and curses. He said he was laying tribute nets—not heading into the Teeth! And now you say no one’s seen him? Then *someone* should be out there looking!”

Toller, trying to keep calm:

> **Toller:**  
> “If he’s out past the black rock, it’s his own damn fault. You know as well as I do—Raven’s Teeth don’t let go.”

If approached, Kira explains:

- Arlen’s nephew drowned in the Teeth during the last cycle.
- Arlen has quietly returned each year to lay tribute nets in his memory.
- This year, he promised Kira he wouldn’t go. Now he’s missing.
- His small boat was last seen heading southeast. Weather is worsening.

> **Kira (quietly):**  
> “He lied. Or maybe he thought I’d stop him. Either way, he’s out there—and if he’s not dead, he’s clinging to something that won’t last the tide.”

---

**Setting: Raven’s Teeth**

- Jagged rock formation southeast of Aldshore.
- Sharp reefs and unpredictable currents.
- Locals avoid it—said to be cursed or unstable.
- Tides here change rapidly, with minimal warning.

---

**Approach & Travel:**

- Players must borrow or hire a vessel (small skiff or local cutter).
- Navigation, Boating, and Observation rolls required.
- Encourage teamwork: one navigates, one watches for hazards, one manages sails/rigging.

**Key Skill Challenges:**

- **Navigation (or Cartography):** Chart safe approach route.  
- **Boating (Sailing):** Handle shifting tides, avoid hull damage.  
- **Observation / Perception:** Spot signs of wreckage, gulls, netting, or movement.  
- **Weather Sense (optional):** Read if another tidal shift is imminent.

---

**Complications (choose one or roll randomly):**

| Situation        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Hidden Shallows  | Unexpected surge nearly capsizes the skiff. Dex roll or capsize risk. |
| Sea Predator     | Reef-serpent (or territorial sea lion) circles the boat. Handle with Intimidation or Animal Handling. |
| Tidal Shift      | Water level begins to rise—forces a timed retreat or flooding risk. |
| Magnetic Pull    | Compasses and bearings spin—forces repeat Navigation checks. |

---

**Encounter:**

- Arlen’s skiff is wedged in a gully between rock spines, cracked but afloat.
- Arlen is barely conscious, sunburnt, and badly dehydrated.
- His net is still out—full of silver fish. Unnatural catch density may feel eerie.

> **Arlen (weakly):**  
> “The fish… they were waiting. Never seen the sea offer so much. I—I thought maybe it was a gift. For him.”

- Optional minor hazard:
  - Giant barnacle latch, waterlogged sea-ghoul arm reaching from below, etc.
  - Not meant as full combat—just tension.

**Rescue Tasks:**

- **Swimming / Climbing / Acrobatics:** Reach Arlen without capsizing.  
- **First Aid or Survival:** Stabilise him before movement.  
- **Rope Use / Coordination:** Haul both man and gear back to vessel.  
- **Teamwork Bonus:** Reduce penalties if roles are well divided.

---

**Return & Outcome:**

- Arlen survives but is weak; deeply shaken by the experience.
- Kira embraces him, then slaps him, then cries.

> **Kira (to PCs):**  
> “You brought him back. That’s more than I thought I’d see again. I owe you.”

- Harbourmaster Toller acknowledges the rescue with quiet respect.  
- Fisherfolk begin treating the party as trustworthy outsiders.

---

**Rewards & Reputation:**

- Minor token from Kira (e.g. charm, family keepsake).  
- Possible fresh fish supplies if requested.  
- +1 **Faction Trust: Fisherfolk**  
- **Toller’s stance shifts to neutral or cautious ally.**

---

**Foreshadowing (optional):**

If desired, Arlen can mention subtle oddities:

> **Arlen (murmuring):**  
> “The tide… it turned *wrong*. Like the sea was waiting for something. I know those rocks. They weren’t where they should be.”

This lays groundwork for Tidecaller Compass-related anomalies without dominating the moment.

- Town turns to players for guidance; choose to stay or urgently depart

**Choices and Consequences:**  
- Departing to safety guarantees survival but potentially damages relations with Aldshore  
- Staying through the cycle secures full Aldshore trust but involves unknown risks

- Emotional NPC appeals (e.g., Serena Halden, Kira Mallen) seeking passage or safety

## Pitch to Players (Video-Game Style):

To mediate the bitter rivalry between the Graysons and the Arkwrights, you'll first need to gain the locals’ trust by completing quests around town. Consider them classic RPG-style side quests: rescuing fishermen, resolving dockside intrigues, and investigating mysterious disappearances. Prove yourselves trustworthy, unravel hidden plots involving Iron Tide pirates and the enigmatic Tidecaller Compass, and ultimately guide Aldshore through an imminent, unpredictable cycle."

## GM Tips & Tone:

- Clearly track trust-building progress visibly for players.
- Roleplay NPC interactions to heighten emotional stakes.
- Emphasize moral ambiguity and player-driven decisions.
- Maintain a video-game RPG tone familiar and appealing to players.
