# Adventure 6: "Uncharted Waters"


## Adventure Overview

Aldshore, a practical coastal settlement in the Kyngesreach Archipelago, is caught in escalating tensions between two influential local families: the shipwright Graysons and the navigator Arkwrights. Outsiders are initially distrusted, so the party must first build trust with various town factions through completing side quests. Only after gaining trust can they effectively mediate the feud and uncover deeper plots involving the Iron Tide pirates and rumours of the mysterious "Tidecaller Compass."

## Introduction - 🎙️ Captain Elias Godfrey – Quarterdeck Address (Opening of *Adventure 6: Uncharted Waters*)

*Setting: Early morning haze. Aldshore just breaking the horizon. Crew assembled, the *Sojourner* steady beneath them. Godfrey stands at the rail, voice quiet but carrying.*

> Crew of the *Sojourner*—listen close.  
>  
> We’ve spent the last week patching sails and watching shadows, and every man and woman aboard knows it’s been earned the hard way. What we faced out there wasn’t storm or shoal—it was the Iron Tide.  
>  
> They came sharp, fast, and proud. And we met them broadside, boarded, bled, and held the line. You kept your nerve when the powder burned. You saved lives. You proved this crew is more than hull and heading—it’s a damn blade in the sea.  
>  
> And now… a little luck.  
>  
> Word from our Iron Tide... acquaintance, has put us on course for Aldshore. A town still standing. Still welcoming. At least, for now. They say she’ll last the cycle. That’s long enough to breathe, if we’re careful.  
>  
> I’m not promising anything. But if there’s a tavern, I expect we’ll find it. If there’s ale, it’ll taste better on solid ground. And if the place has sense, they’ll trade drink for coin and ask fewer questions than we’ve had to answer lately.  
>  
> I won’t begrudge any of it. In fact, I expect it.  
>  
> You’ve earned the right to walk like your boots belong to you. To speak easy. To feel, just for an evening, that the world’s a little less broken than it’s looked lately.  
>  
> But remember what carries us—discipline, not indulgence. Respect the town, respect its people, and remember: when they see you, they see the *Sojourner*. Make that mean something.  
>  
> Look after your mates—have some dignity, and if the marines have to carry your sodden arse back on board, you’d best pray that I don’t hear about it.

## ⚖️ Main Quest: Calming the Waters

**Goal:**  
Gain the trust of Aldshore’s two rival power groups—Graysons (shipwrights) and Arkwrights (navigators)—to resolve a leadership dispute that’s stalled trade and locked down vital information.

---

### 🎯 Why the Party Gets Involved

- The party arrives with **cargo to sell** (textiles, herbs from the *Morningstar*).
- They expect to offload it, resupply, and maybe gather information before Aldshore slips out of reach.
- But they find the docks in **practical gridlock**—vessels idle, manifests disputed, no one signing off.

> “We’ve got goods. They’ve got coin. But no one’s moving until someone breaks this standoff.”

- Dockmaster Willem Toller makes it clear:
  - **No outsider trades** are being processed.
  - **Neither the Graysons nor Arkwrights** will authorise cargo clearance.
  - If the party wants to do business—or get real answers—they’ll need to make themselves useful.

> “Don’t care what flag you fly—if you want into Aldshore’s ledger, start by making some friends.”

---

### 🔥 Context: A Leadership Dispute

- The **Graysons** blame the **Arkwrights** for navigational misjudgements that caused damage, losses, and possibly sabotage.
- The **Arkwrights** accuse the **Graysons** of withholding repairs and stoking internal division.
- Both sides are **too proud to back down**, and too suspicious to cooperate.
- Outsiders are seen as **potential pawns**—but also as convenient neutral ground.

---

### 🧍‍♀️ Faction Positions

- **Rowena Arkwright**  
  - Analytical, respected, under pressure.  
  - Concerned about her missing nephew Merric, who vanished pursuing a theory about cycle behaviour.  
  - Suspects foul play—or external manipulation.

- **Eldric Grayson**  
  - Hard-bitten, proud, and no longer patient.  
  - Furious over missing tools and wrecked gear.  
  - Believes the Arkwrights are hiding something—or covering incompetence.

---

### 🧭 How the Party Gains Influence

The families don’t respond to talk—they respond to **proof**.  
Each side has real problems that aren’t being addressed because of the dispute.

By helping local citizens through **side quests**, the players build visible trust:

- “Lost at Sea” = community goodwill, stabilises dock morale.
- “The Quiet Dockhand” = earns Toller’s respect, exposes outside interference.
- “Missing Navigator” = breaks Arkwright silence.
- “Smuggler’s Rest” = restores Grayson standing and reveals shared enemy.

Once enough side quests are complete, the party has:
- **Trust to speak with both families**, and
- **Leverage to push them into dialogue**.

---

### 🤝 Resolution Scene

A final scene sees the players:
- Present what they’ve uncovered (Iron Tide signs, Merric’s message, sabotage details).
- Push for practical cooperation—**not peace, just function**.

They don’t make allies. They make **commerce and conversation possible again**.

---

### 🧾 Outcome:

- The docks reopen to Sojourner trade.  
- Rowena or Eldric share crucial information—about **cycles**, **Merric’s research**, and eventually the **Tidecaller Compass**.  
- Town returns to uneasy function just long enough for the players to get what they need.

**Note:** The crew can still enjoy tavern time throughout.  
This conflict doesn’t lock the town—it just **locks access to useful high-level answers and trade routes** until resolved.

### 🧿 Recurring Vosk Gag: "Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!"

Use these interludes between quests or scenes. Vosk must see the sahuagin first and deliver the exact same line every time. Players may intervene—pointlessly.

---

#### 🐟 Encounter 1: Fish Presentation

- The party is passing the docks.  
- Vosk drops a crate and stares toward the water.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- Two sahuagin rise waist-deep from the sea, one holding a **single fish** on a polished plank.  
- They gently **tilt the plank toward Vosk**, nod, and submerge.

---

#### 🐚 Encounter 2: Tavern Visitation

- Inside the tavern, mid-meal.  
- The door creaks open. Two dripping sahuagin step inside.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- One walks up to Vosk and solemnly **places a seashell** on his table.  
- They bow to the room and leave. No one else reacts.

---

#### 🌙 Encounter 3: Moonlit Chase

- Party sees Vosk **sprinting past them** at night.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- A single sahuagin is walking calmly down the street behind him, holding a **small lantern made of coral**.  
- It does not speed up. It does not stop. It just watches.

---

#### 🪢 Encounter 4: Dockside Knotwork

- PCs spot Vosk arguing with a rope vendor.  
- Behind him, a sahuagin silently **ties a knot** in a coil of spare rope.  
- The knot resembles a spiral.  
> Vosk turns, freezes. “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- The sahuagin gives him a **thumbs-up**, then steps backward off the dock into the water.

---

#### 🪦 Encounter 5: Shell Arrangement

- Party returns to the ship and finds **spiral shell patterns** arranged neatly on the deck near Vosk’s hammock.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- He points at them, panic rising.  
- There are no sahuagin in sight—until one **slowly surfaces**, salutes, and sinks again without a word.

---

#### 🎶 Encounter 6: Choral Murmurs

- While crossing town, the PCs hear **strange harmonic humming** echoing through an alley.  
- Vosk is backing out slowly.  
> “Oh no! The sahuagin have found me!”  
- Three sahuagin are standing in perfect unison, making low melodic clicks.  
- One produces a **tiny harp made of fishbone**, strums a note, and walks away.

---

## 🐟 The Sahuagin Wedding of Larman Vosk

**Trigger:**  
This event occurs after the final side quest and before or during the “Imminent Cycle” main event. It should interrupt something important.

---

### 🎬 Setting:

- **Location:** Low stone quay outside Aldshore.  
- **Time:** High tide. Full moon.  
- **Atmosphere:** The sea is glass-calm. The sky is cloudless. The air carries a faint tang of brine and ceremony.

---

### 🎭 The Procession:

- Ten sahuagin emerge from the sea in ritual formation.
- Each wears robes of woven kelp, crusted coral, and faded linen banners with spiral glyphs.
- A slow, solemn music plays—reef-horns and hollow bone flutes in an unsettlingly irregular rhythm.
- They carry no weapons. Only tradition.

---

### 🎩 The Ceremonial Hat:

- Towering, ridiculous, and reverent.  
- Constructed from lacquered crab shells.  
- Fan coral antlers reach a metre wide, each dangling with live sea anemones.  
- Salt-rimed netting trails over the face like a bridal veil, embedded with glass shards, fishbone, and a whole barnacled clam.  
- From the crown dangles a driftwood plank etched in curling runes:
  - *“Tide Claimed. Moon Witnessed. He is Taken.”*
- The entire structure makes a quiet **gurgling** noise when worn, like a sponge thinking hard.

---

### 👰🏾 The Ceremony:

- Vosk tries to flee. Two sahuagin step calmly to either side and wait. He freezes.
- The music rises.
- A pair of attendants place the hat on his head. It *sinks slightly*, as if tasting him.
- The High Priestess raises her kelp-wrapped staff.

She chants for several minutes—tones and clicks that have never been heard above water.

Then, with slow solemnity, she taps Vosk **twice on the chest** with the staff.

> **High Priestess Nalqua (translated, if attempted):**  
> “The debt is satisfied. The reef releases its claim.”

And just like that—  
They turn.  
And return to the sea.

---

### 🧘 Aftermath:

- Vosk is left standing alone.
- The hat remains. The music stops. The tide begins to recede.
- No one speaks. Even the gulls are silent.
- Only the faint **gurgle** of ceremonial dampness can be heard from the hat.

The sahuagin do not return.

---

### 🎭 Final Epilogue (End of Session):

- The party finds Vosk later, sitting at the edge of the quay.
- He is still wearing the hat.

If approached:

> **Vosk (softly):**  
> “Oh no... they’re gone.”  
> *(pause)*  
> “...I think I miss them.”

---

### 🪖 Post-Wedding Vosk Behaviour Protocol (Epilogue)

- Vosk **wears the hat at all times**. It does not slip. It does not tilt. It is *resolute*.
- When asked about it, he responds with total sincerity:

> **Vosk:**  
> “What hat?”

- The hat emits occasional, unpredictable sounds:
  - *flobber*
  - *drup*
  - *klik-kloonk*
  - *grallll*
  - *glurb*
  - *enthusiastic bubbling*

- If a player attempts to remove it:
  - The moment their fingers touch it, it emits a defensive *squelch* and goes slightly warm.
  - A **gentle but unrelenting suction** holds it in place.
  - Strength rolls accomplish nothing. Magic slides off like oil on kelp.

> **Optional GM Response (if they persist):**  
> “You feel an ancient and unspoken pressure, as though a billion solemn fish are watching, disappointed.”

- If Detect Magic or similar is used:
  - The hat lights up like a beacon. Schools of nearby fish immediately change direction.
  - Interpretation attempts yield only:
    - “Conjuration.”  
    - “Binding.”  
    - And “Possibly ceremonial etiquette enforcement.”

**Note:**  
Under no circumstances is this hat to be stolen, removed, or repurposed. It is not loot. It is **a burden**.  
One Vosk must carry.  
With honour.  
And *glurb*.




## Side Quests (Reputation Building)

### 🧭 Side Quest 1: "Lost at Sea"

**Objective:**  
Rescue fisherman Arlen Mallen, missing near the Raven’s Teeth—against all better judgement.

---

**Hook / Discovery:**

At the fishmarket, the party overhears a tense exchange. Kira Mallen is confronting Harbourmaster Willem Toller, her voice sharp with grief and anger.

> **Kira Mallen (to Toller):**  
> “Don’t feed me tales of tides and curses. He said he was laying tribute nets—not heading into the Teeth! And now you say no one’s seen him? Then *someone* should be out there looking!”

Toller, trying to keep calm:

> **Toller:**  
> “If he’s out past the black rock, it’s his own damn fault. You know as well as I do—Raven’s Teeth don’t let go.”

If approached, Kira explains:

- Arlen’s nephew drowned in the Teeth during the last cycle.
- Arlen has quietly returned each year to lay tribute nets in his memory.
- This year, he promised Kira he wouldn’t go. Now he’s missing.
- His small boat was last seen heading southeast. Weather is worsening.

> **Kira (quietly):**  
> “He lied. Or maybe he thought I’d stop him. Either way, he’s out there—and if he’s not dead, he’s clinging to something that won’t last the tide.”

---

**Setting: Raven’s Teeth**

- Jagged rock formation southeast of Aldshore.
- Sharp reefs and unpredictable currents.
- Locals avoid it—said to be cursed or unstable.
- Tides here change rapidly, with minimal warning.

---

**Approach & Travel:**

- Players must borrow or hire a vessel (small skiff or local cutter).
- Navigation, Boating, and Observation rolls required.
- Encourage teamwork: one navigates, one watches for hazards, one manages sails/rigging.

**Key Skill Challenges:**

- **Navigation (or Cartography):** Chart safe approach route.  
- **Boating (Sailing):** Handle shifting tides, avoid hull damage.  
- **Observation / Perception:** Spot signs of wreckage, gulls, netting, or movement.  
- **Weather Sense (optional):** Read if another tidal shift is imminent.

---

**Complications (choose one or roll randomly):**

| Situation        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Hidden Shallows  | Unexpected surge nearly capsizes the skiff. Dex roll or capsize risk. |
| Sea Predator     | Reef-serpent (or territorial sea lion) circles the boat. Handle with Intimidation or Animal Handling. |
| Tidal Shift      | Water level begins to rise—forces a timed retreat or flooding risk. |
| Magnetic Pull    | Compasses and bearings spin—forces repeat Navigation checks. |

---

**Encounter:**

- Arlen’s skiff is wedged in a gully between rock spines, cracked but afloat.
- Arlen is barely conscious, sunburnt, and badly dehydrated.
- His net is still out—full of silver fish. Unnatural catch density may feel eerie.

> **Arlen (weakly):**  
> “The fish… they were waiting. Never seen the sea offer so much. I—I thought maybe it was a gift. For him.”

- Optional minor hazard:
  - Giant barnacle latch, waterlogged sea-ghoul arm reaching from below, etc.
  - Not meant as full combat—just tension.

**Rescue Tasks:**

- **Swimming / Climbing / Acrobatics:** Reach Arlen without capsizing.  
- **First Aid or Survival:** Stabilise him before movement.  
- **Rope Use / Coordination:** Haul both man and gear back to vessel.  
- **Teamwork Bonus:** Reduce penalties if roles are well divided.

---

**Return & Outcome:**

- Arlen survives but is weak; deeply shaken by the experience.
- Kira embraces him, then slaps him, then cries.

> **Kira (to PCs):**  
> “You brought him back. That’s more than I thought I’d see again. I owe you.”

- Harbourmaster Toller acknowledges the rescue with quiet respect.  
- Fisherfolk begin treating the party as trustworthy outsiders.

---

**Rewards & Reputation:**

- Minor token from Kira (e.g. charm, family keepsake).  
- Possible fresh fish supplies if requested.  
- +1 **Faction Trust: Fisherfolk**  
- **Toller’s stance shifts to neutral or cautious ally.**

---

**Foreshadowing (optional):**

If desired, Arlen can mention subtle oddities:

> **Arlen (murmuring):**  
> “The tide… it turned *wrong*. Like the sea was waiting for something. I know those rocks. They weren’t where they should be.”

This lays groundwork for Tidecaller Compass-related anomalies without dominating the moment.

---

### ⚓ Side Quest 2: "The Quiet Dockhand"

**Objective:**  
Discover why dockhand Finn is behaving strangely and resolve the blackmail situation discreetly.

---

**Hook / Discovery:**

While moving cargo or speaking with Willem Toller at the harbour, the party notices one of the younger dockhands—**Finn**—flinching, distracted, and nervously scanning the crowds.

> **Toller (if asked):**  
> “Finn’s been off lately. Jumpier than a cat in a storm hold. Still works hard, but something’s wrong. Doesn’t say a word about it.”

A quick Observation or Human Behaviour check reveals Finn:
- Avoids eye contact with authority.
- Visibly reacts when a certain sailor or warehouse worker passes by.
- Slips away during breaks to the far end of the docks.

---

**NPCs & Relationships:**

- **Finn** – Young dockhand, anxious, not streetwise. Wants to escape his situation but doesn’t know how.
- **Willem Toller** – Harbourmaster. Fair-minded, not cruel. Will support the PCs’ handling if it’s clean and doesn’t embarrass him.
- **Clem Vatcher** – The blackmailer. A mid-level Iron Tide informant posing as a petty cargo handler. Greedy, arrogant, subtle.

---

**Investigation Phase (Brief):**

Following Finn discreetly leads to:
- Him meeting Clem in a shadowed corner behind warehouse #3.
- Clem quietly **threatening to expose something** unless Finn keeps “finding space” in the manifests.

If players confront Finn directly:
> **Finn (panicked):**  
> “I didn’t know who they were at first—I swear. Just said move crates, fudge the log. Then they said if I told anyone—if I *even looked wrong*—they’d drown me in the dark.”

He won’t give up Clem’s name without reassurance or social pressure.

---

**Confrontation Options:**

The party can now resolve the issue by choosing one of several methods:

1. **Diplomacy / Persuasion:**
   - Approach Clem discreetly. Offer a bribe, threaten exposure, or broker Finn’s withdrawal.
   - Clem backs down if he thinks the Harbourmaster is watching.

2. **Intimidation:**
   - Corner Clem alone. A short, direct warning such as:
> “Bad idea threatening dockhands while we’re in town. Makes us take an interest we wouldn’t otherwise have.”

3. **Stealth / Subterfuge:**
   - Catch Clem red-handed slipping Iron Tide markings or false cargo onto a manifest.
   - Present this to Toller or threaten to expose it.

---

**Outcome & Resolution:**

- Clem flees town or goes quiet, depending on approach.
- Finn is grateful, shaken, and returns to work with renewed focus.
- Toller quietly pulls the party aside:

> **Toller:**  
> “Don’t know what you did. Don’t want to know. But Finn’s back on his feet, and my docks are quieter for it. You’ve got my eye—and my thanks.”

---

**Rewards & Reputation:**

- Quiet respect from Willem Toller.  
- Trust among the **dockworkers**.  
- Access to restricted dock areas or faster port operations later if relevant.  
- +1 **Faction Trust: Dockworkers / Harbourmaster**

---

**Optional Clue:**

If players dig or question Clem:
- He mutters something about “the Tide having eyes everywhere.”
- A crate nearby bears the spiral marking seen in previous Stormcaller dealings—hastily scratched off.

> **Clem (bitterly):**  
> “Tell your captain this port won’t last the cycle. You’re just renting time.”

---

### 🧭 Side Quest 3: "Missing Navigator"

**Objective:**  
Investigate the mysterious disappearance of Merric Halden, a respected Arkwright navigator—last seen behaving strangely, then vanishing without explanation.

---

**Hook / Initial Contact:**

After gaining some local trust, the party is granted an audience with **Rowena Arkwright**, who remains reserved but practical. She sets them a task:

> **Rowena (coolly):**  
> “You want to prove your usefulness? Find my nephew. He left without word, without charts, and with more confidence than caution. That’s not like him.”

---

**Key NPCs:**

- **Rowena Arkwright** – Navigator matriarch. Allows the party to investigate, reluctantly.  
- **Serena Halden** – Merric’s wife. Kind but exhausted. She knew he was anxious about the coming cycle, but didn’t expect him to act without telling her.  
- **Dockworkers & neighbours** – Some saw signs of Merric preparing to slip away.

---

**Investigation Phase (Brief):**

The players visit **Merric’s cottage**. Serena is present and cooperative if treated gently. She gives them access to Merric’s notes and workspace.

Key Discoveries:

1. **Private notes and charts** (Navigation or Occultism check to interpret):
   - Detailed attempts to **predict cycle timing**, with annotations like:
     > *“Pattern not holding. Drift compression increasing.”*  
     > *“This place will shift soon. Must be beyond sight when it happens.”*

2. **A folded letter with no signature**, suggesting:
   - A rendezvous “beyond the southern bluff.”
   - Reference to “an alternate route out—not by map, but by timing.”

3. **Marked chart** showing a cove near **Smuggler’s Rest**, annotated:
   > *“Wait for third pull of the ebb. Passage only holds at slack.”*

A **dockhand** (with minimal persuasion) admits Merric left in the early hours, travelling light, “like he had something to prove.”

---

**Lore Clarification:**

- Everyone in Aldshore knows **cycle shifts** are real—ships that vanish, islands that move, routes that don’t stay fixed.
- That’s why **inshore navigation is standard practice**, especially when signs point to an imminent shift.
- Merric’s actions were reckless *because* he stopped following those norms. He believed he could **escape the timing** if he understood it deeply enough.

This puts the first concrete question in the party’s hands:
> “Can the cycles be predicted? Or even outrun?”

---

**Outcome & Reward:**

- The party earns **Rowena’s cautious respect**—they’ve shown discretion and competence.
- Serena quietly thanks them, but worries the truth won’t be something she wants to hear.
- The cove near **Smuggler’s Rest** becomes the next destination.

---

**Faction Trust: Arkwright Family +1**

**New Thread Unlocked:**  
→ Begin *Side Quest 4: Smuggler’s Rest*


---

### 🛶 Side Quest 4: "Smuggler’s Rest"

**Objective:**  
Track down Merric Halden’s last known location at a remote cove, recover stolen Grayson shipwright tools, and confront Iron Tide agents operating near Aldshore.

---

**Setup:**

Using Merric’s marked charts and notes from *“Missing Navigator”*, the party sails or hikes to a narrow cove south of Aldshore—known locally as **Smuggler’s Rest**.

It’s a half-forgotten inlet used by fringe traders, castoffs, and sometimes worse. Locals avoid it—especially near a cycle change.

---

**Key NPCs:**

- **Merric Halden** – The missing navigator. Found held under loose guard in a tide-carved shelter. He’s unharmed, but rattled and sleepless.  
- **Quinn Darrow** – Iron Tide scout leader. Smooth, mercenary, not fanatical. Prefers advantage to bloodshed.  
- **Two Iron Tide operatives** – Alert, lightly armed. Will escalate only if provoked.

---

**The Encounter:**

The players find a **makeshift Iron Tide camp**, hidden under a jutting bluff above the cove. A skiff is tethered offshore. Crates nearby bear Grayson marking stamps—some pried off, others half-burned.

**Merric is alive**, inside a shelter, speaking calmly with Quinn when the party arrives.

The players can approach in several ways:

---

### 🗣️ Resolution Options:

**1. Stealth & Overwhelm**  
- Players ambush the camp. Fight is short and sharp.
- Merric survives but is shaken. Some tools may be damaged.

**2. Parley / Negotiation**  
- Quinn is open to a deal:
  - Let them go with one crate (tools or a decoy),
  - And they leave Merric and the rest untouched.
  - Or: small bribe, misinformation, or bluff can turn the encounter.

> **Quinn (casually):**  
> “This place won’t last the season. We’re just looking for leverage—he had theories. You want him, take him. But be quick about it.”

**3. Deception**  
- Players pretend to be neutral smugglers or Tide sympathisers.
- Can extract Merric and slip away without combat.

---

### 🧠 Lore Unlock (from Merric or Quinn):  

#### What Merric reveals:

> “I thought it was just drift theory, but the patterns held. Ships moving *before* the change. Navigating through it. That’s not luck. That’s something else.  
> They found me just as I was getting close. I think… I think they don’t want people knowing the timing can be *beaten*.”

He doesn’t know what a **Tidecaller Compass** is—but he knows someone is navigating cycles on purpose. And it scared him.

#### What Quinn might say, if pressured:

> “He wasn’t a threat. Just inconvenient. Some knowledge ought to stay proprietary.”

---

### 🧾 Outcome:

- Merric is returned to Rowena, who is quietly stunned—and grateful.
- The stolen **Grayson tools** are recovered intact or mostly intact.
- If players handled it without bloodshed, both sides remark on their restraint and competence.

---

**Faction Trust:**
- **Arkwright Family +1** (rescuing Merric)
- **Grayson Family +1** (returning tools)

---

**Unlocks:**
- **Main quest resolution now possible**: both factions will talk.
- **Tidecaller Compass** is now a concrete lead—not named, but strongly implied.


---


## Optional Side Encounter: "The Old Salt’s Tale"

**Objective:**  
Engage Old Gideon, a retired sailor, in storytelling to learn Stormcaller lore.

**NPC:**  
- Old Gideon (retired sailor, storyteller)

**Encounter:**  
- Roleplay encounter at tavern, detailed narrative from Gideon about his youthful Stormcaller encounter  
- Players use Insight or Charisma skills to gather accurate information

**Rewards:**  
- Atmospheric and narrative depth  
- Partial clues to future quests involving Stormcallers and Tidecaller Compass  
- Possible location of hidden cove or cache for future exploration

---


## Final Quest: "Imminent Cycle Decision"

**Objective:**  
Make a crucial decision when signs of an impending cycle threaten Aldshore’s stability.

**Encounter:**  
- Players observe clear cycle signals (strange tides, animal behaviours, weather)  
- Town turns to players for guidance; choose to stay or urgently depart

**Choices and Consequences:**  
- Departing to safety guarantees survival but potentially damages relations with Aldshore  
- Staying through the cycle secures full Aldshore trust but involves unknown risks

**Additional Stakes:**  
- Emotional NPC appeals (e.g., Serena Halden, Kira Mallen) seeking passage or safety

| Early tavern/local scenes         | Dockworkers, Kira, Toller   | “Aldshore’s safe *this* cycle.” / “Stick to inshore routes. Don’t risk a shift.”                 | Casual superstition            |
| During “Missing Navigator”        | Serena, notes, Rowena       | Merric believed the **cycles could be predicted**. Thought he could find a way to “step out.”     | Emotional concern / suspicion  |
| Mid-investigation notes           | Merric’s charts             | Diagrams and notations that suggest **non-random pattern detection**                             | Navigation skill/occultism     |
| “Smuggler’s Rest” (camp found)    | Quinn Darrow or Merric      | Iron Tide **uses something** to predict or survive cycles. Merric noticed this.                  | Verbal interrogation           |
| “Smuggler’s Rest” (Merric reveals)| Merric Halden               | “They didn’t want me to talk. They’re *using* something. A device. It stabilises the route.”     | Nervous, but lucid             |
| If players push further           | Merric (follow-up)          | “They didn’t make it. The **Stormcallers** did. That’s the name I heard. A cult—or a sect.”       | Quiet drop, first naming       |
| Optional item find (camp loot)    | Iron Tide crate or mapcase  | Labelled “S.C. Driftlock—return to Coilbase before tide shift.”                                  | Physical clue                  |
| Post-resolution debrief (optional)| Toller, Rowena (if asked)   | “Stormcallers... I’ve heard the name. Always just before trouble. Always near a shift.”          | Suspicious, but indirect       |

**GM Notes:**

- The **name “Stormcaller”** should drop **once only**—preferably from Merric, in a moment of low-key delivery.
- The **players should realise its weight** through context, not exposition. Merric knows they’re real. Rowena suspects. Quinn doesn’t care—he just uses their tools.
- Later adventures will deepen this: the cult’s purpose, methods, and origin can unfold slowly.

**Pacing Suggestion:**

Don’t confirm everything. Drop the pieces. Let players start the theorising.

## Pitch to Players (Video-Game Style):

> "You've arrived at Aldshore, a port town deeply suspicious of outsiders. To mediate the bitter rivalry between the Graysons and the Arkwrights, you'll first need to gain the locals’ trust by completing quests around town. Consider them classic RPG-style side quests: rescuing fishermen, resolving dockside intrigues, and investigating mysterious disappearances. Prove yourselves trustworthy, unravel hidden plots involving Iron Tide pirates and the enigmatic Tidecaller Compass, and ultimately guide Aldshore through an imminent, unpredictable cycle."

## GM Tips & Tone:

- Clearly track trust-building progress visibly for players.
- Roleplay NPC interactions to heighten emotional stakes.
- Emphasize moral ambiguity and player-driven decisions.
- Maintain a video-game RPG tone familiar and appealing to players.

This structured, RPG-inspired adventure format should be easy to reference during play, providing a clear progression and plenty of immersive roleplaying opportunities.
