# Adventure 6: "Uncharted Waters"

## Adventure Overview

Aldshore, a practical coastal settlement in the Kyngesreach Archipelago, is caught in escalating tensions between two influential local families: the shipwright Graysons and the navigator Arkwrights. Outsiders are initially distrusted, so the party must first build trust with various town factions through completing side quests. Only after gaining trust can they effectively mediate the feud and uncover deeper plots involving the Iron Tide pirates and rumours of the mysterious "Tidecaller Compass."

## Introduction - 🎙️ Captain Elias Godfrey – Quarterdeck Address (Opening of *Adventure 6: Uncharted Waters*)

*Setting: Early morning haze. Aldshore just breaking the horizon. Crew assembled, the *Sojourner* steady beneath them. Godfrey stands at the rail, voice quiet but carrying.*

> Crew of the *Sojourner*—listen close.  
>  
> We’ve spent the last week patching sails and watching shadows, and every man and woman aboard knows it’s been earned the hard way. What we faced out there wasn’t storm or shoal—it was the Iron Tide.  
>  
> They came sharp, fast, and proud. And we met them broadside, boarded, bled, and held the line. You kept your nerve when the powder burned. You saved lives. You proved this crew is more than hull and heading—it’s a damn blade in the sea.  
>  
> And now… a little luck.  
>  
> Word from our Iron Tide... acquaintance, has put us on course for Aldshore. A town still standing. Still welcoming. At least, for now. They say she’ll last the cycle. That’s long enough to breathe, if we’re careful.  
>  
> I’m not promising anything. But if there’s a tavern, I expect we’ll find it. If there’s ale, it’ll taste better on solid ground. And if the place has sense, they’ll trade drink for coin and ask fewer questions than we’ve had to answer lately.  
>  
> I won’t begrudge any of it. In fact, I expect it.  
>  
> You’ve earned the right to walk like your boots belong to you. To speak easy. To feel, just for an evening, that the world’s a little less broken than it’s looked lately.  
>  
> But remember what carries us—discipline, not indulgence. Respect the town, respect its people, and remember: when they see you, they see the *Sojourner*. Make that mean something.  
>  
> Look after your mates—have some dignity, and if the marines have to carry your sodden arse back on board, you’d best pray that I don’t hear about it.

Consider them classic RPG-style side quests: rescuing fishermen, resolving dockside intrigues, and investigating mysterious disappearances. Prove yourselves trustworthy, unravel hidden plots involving Iron Tide pirates and the enigmatic Tidecaller Compass, and ultimately guide Aldshore through an imminent, unpredictable cycle."
