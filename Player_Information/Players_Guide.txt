This guide provides essential information for players about the setting, technology, and tone of the campaign. It contains no spoilers about the deeper mysteries of the archipelago but serves as a reference for understanding the world, character options, and what to expect.

### General Setting Overview
The campaign is set in a world of **uncharted seas, lost civilizations, and perilous adventure**. It begins in a **mainland port city**, where the party will prepare for an expedition into the mysterious Kyngesreach Archipelago—a place shrouded in myth, legend, and danger. Few who travel there return, but those who do speak of strange islands, forgotten ruins, and vast treasures hidden in the unknown waters.

This campaign is heavily inspired by swashbuckling adventure tales, Age of Sail exploration, and episodic storytelling similar to classic *Star Trek* and *The Odyssey*. Expect a mix of **action, intrigue, discovery, and moral dilemmas**, as well as occasional moments of lighthearted fun.

### Technology Level: Early TL4 (1700s Era)
The game world is set at **early TL4**, roughly equivalent to the early 1700s. This means:
- **Firearms:** Flintlock pistols and muskets are available but have slow reload times, making melee weapons still widely used.
- **No Rifling:** Standard firearms are **smoothbore only**. Rifling is not available, though it might exist as an experimental or lost technology.
- **Cannons:** Naval combat revolves around **muzzle-loading cannons** and **swivel guns** rather than rapid-fire weaponry.
- **Ships:** Sailing vessels dominate trade and warfare. Steam power does not exist.
- **Navigation:** Tools like astrolabes, sextants, and early chronometers are used for plotting courses, but navigation remains an art as much as a science.

Technology is **low enough to keep combat dangerous and engaging**, ensuring that resourcefulness and strategy matter more than firepower alone.

### Magic in the Setting
Magic exists, but it is not as common or overt as in some fantasy settings. Instead, it is mysterious, often tied to ancient civilizations, elemental forces, or rare individuals with unique abilities. Magic users exist, but large-scale magical warfare is rare, and most people treat magic with reverence or fear. Common magical themes include:
- Ancient artifacts and runes with lost powers.
- Elemental magic linked to the sea, wind, and storms.
- Curses, hexes, and lingering effects from past ages.
- Mystics and scholars seeking knowledge from forgotten texts.

Those who wield magic are often seen as outcasts, sages, or figures of great intrigue rather than battlefield juggernauts.

### The Party’s Ship
The party will **acquire a ship early in the campaign**, which will serve as their home, stronghold, and primary means of exploration. The ship is crucial to survival, and keeping it seaworthy will be just as important as personal combat skills.

Two potential ship types are under consideration:
- **A Brig-Sloop:** Fast, maneuverable, and suited for quick engagements and exploration.
- **A Small Frigate:** More heavily armed and better suited for stand-up fights but slower and requiring more crew.

The final choice of ship will depend on the players’ preferences and playstyle. Regardless of the type, the ship will be customizable and upgradable throughout the campaign.

### Tone and Style of Play
This is a campaign for experienced roleplayers who enjoy a mix of **serious adventure, exploration, and moral dilemmas**. While there will be **lighthearted moments and humor**, the setting also includes **darker themes such as survival, political intrigue, and difficult choices**. It is not a grimdark setting, but actions have consequences, and not every problem can be solved with a sword.

Key themes include:
- **Exploration & Discovery:** Uncharted lands, mysterious ruins, and ancient secrets.
- **Survival & Strategy:** Resource management, ship maintenance, and clever problem-solving.
- **Moral Dilemmas:** Complex choices where there may not be a clear right or wrong answer.
- **Naval Combat & Boarding Actions:** Tactical ship battles and swashbuckling fights.
- **Factions & Politics:** Pirates, merchant guilds, and enigmatic figures pulling the strings behind the scenes.

---

### Character Considerations
Players should create characters that **have a reason to join the expedition**. The journey into the unknown is not for the faint-hearted, so each character should have a personal motivation for undertaking this dangerous voyage. Possible motivations include:
- Seeking treasure, fame, or glory.
- Searching for lost knowledge or ancient artifacts.
- Running from something in their past (criminal charges, debt, exile, etc.).
- Following a religious or spiritual calling.
- Being blackmailed, coerced, or forced into the journey.

Characters will **not** start out as world-shaking heroes. They will be **capable adventurers**, but they will need to grow and adapt to the challenges of the archipelago.

---

### Game Expectations
- **Roleplaying & Player Agency:** The campaign is open-ended, and choices matter. Players are encouraged to engage with the world, take risks, and shape the narrative.
- **Challenges & Difficulty:** Not every fight is meant to be won. Some enemies are too strong to fight head-on, and clever thinking is required.
- **Teamwork Matters:** Cooperation and planning will help the group survive against the many dangers they will face.
- **Naval Rules:** There will be mechanics for ship maintenance, supplies, and upgrades, but they will be designed to enhance play rather than bog it down with excessive bookkeeping.
