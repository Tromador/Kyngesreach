Kyngesreach Campaign - Player Guide to Prize Money and Profits

Overview:
As participants in the expedition into the Kyngesreach Archipelago, you (the players) will have the opportunity to acquire wealth through treasure, salvage, and valuable cargo. This guide explains how profits are divided between you and the ship’s crew, ensuring fair compensation and maintaining shipboard morale.

Profit Division:
- **60% of the total profits:** Allocated to the ship for crew pay, supplies, repairs, and operating costs.
- **40% of the total profits:** Allocated to the players (PCs), divided equally among the party.

Player Benefits:
- Players receive a 40% share of all profits from treasure and sales.
- Players may retain select valuable items (e.g., rare weapons, masterwork gear, magical items) before monetary division.
- Your share can be spent freely on personal equipment, bribes, or other expenses.

Emergency Expenses:
Maintaining the ship and keeping the crew content is vital for survival. In emergencies (such as urgent repairs, resupply, or unforeseen expenses):
- Funds will be drawn from the players’ share before affecting crew pay.
- This policy ensures crew morale remains high and prevents potential unrest.
- Players are encouraged to balance personal wealth with the ship’s ongoing needs.

Example Scenario:
- **Treasure Haul Value:** 10,000 gold coins
  - Ship Fund (60%): 6,000 gold (used for crew wages, repairs, and supplies)
  - Player Pool (40%): 4,000 gold (1,000 gold per player if there are four PCs)
- **Emergency Repairs Cost:** 2,500 gold
  - Funds are taken from the players’ pool, leaving 1,500 gold total for the party.

Why This Matters:
- **Crew Loyalty:** Satisfied crew members are essential for smooth voyages. Ignoring their well-being can lead to complications.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Investing in ship repairs and supplies ensures you can reach distant islands safely.
- **Strategic Choices:** Spend wisely—hoarding wealth at the expense of the ship may have consequences.

Final Notes:
The profit-sharing system rewards you for your risks while acknowledging the importance of a well-maintained vessel and loyal crew. Strategic use of your share will improve survival chances and enhance your expedition’s success.
