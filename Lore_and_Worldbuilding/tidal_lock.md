# 🌀 The Tidal Lock & the Tidecallers' Seal

> "The sea does not sleep. It holds its breath." — whispered by Biele, possessed

## Overview

The Tidal Lock is not a natural phenomenon—it is a barrier, a seal, and a test.  
It exists to prevent ships from *leaving* the Kyngesreach Archipelago without fulfilling a condition known only to the Tidecallers, the reclusive mystic leaders of the Stormcallers' Cult.

The players’ ship, the Sojourner, will encounter the Lock when attempting to leave the Reach—*not* when entering. This encounter is intended to trap them within the campaign zone, without making the barrier feel arbitrary.

## ⚓ Behaviour of the Lock

**Entering the Reach:**  
- Calm weather, favourable wind. Stars visible. Instruments steady.  
- A false sense of welcome—the sea lures them in.

**Attempting to Exit:**  
- Storms form from nothing. Clouds gather like bruises.  
- Wind reverses violently. Tides rise to impossible heights.  
- Visibility collapses. Compass fails. Waves slam with intentional force.  
- Navigation becomes fatal.

**Retreating Back In:**  
- Storm ceases. Calm returns instantly.  
- No trace of the violence remains. But the message is clear:  
  *You are not permitted to leave.*

## 🌑 The Purpose of the Lock

The Tidecallers do not build prisons lightly. Their reasons may include:

- **To guard the Kyng Below** – A primordial being said to slumber beneath the archipelago.
- **To contain the Scar** – A metaphysical wound in the world, older than memory.
- **To preserve the Balance** – To stop corrupted knowledge from escaping the sea.

Only the Stormcallers know which is true—perhaps all three are.

## 🔐 The Secret Exit

There **is** a way out—but it is not known to the players early. Escape requires:

- **Ritual permission** from the Stormcallers.  
- Completion of a **spiritual or symbolic trial**.  
- Sacrifice of **treasure, memory, or crew**.  
- **Carrying a mark**—a sigil, artefact, or curse—sanctioning passage.

> "There is no door. There is only invitation." — Tidecaller doctrine

Enzo Falciere's contact with Stormcaller agents on the mainland proves the barrier is *selectively permeable*. The cult has its own method—and might offer it later… at a cost.

## 📚 GM Notes

- The Tidal Lock exists to support the campaign structure, not block creativity.  
- If players find clever ways to bypass it, let them—but always demand a price.  
- The Lock should feel alive—the sea chooses when it opens or closes.

## 🧠 Foreshadowing Tools

Use these to plant early seeds:

- **Biele’s visions:** "The sea does not sleep. It holds its breath."  
- **Rumours from survivors:** "They turned back too late. The sea ate them whole."  
- **Ghost charts:** Maps that fade when the ship turns to flee the Reach.
