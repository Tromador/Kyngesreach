Supply Tracking & Mechanics

Resource management is critical to survival and success in the Kyngesreach Archipelago:

Tracked Resources:
- **Food:** Essential for morale; shortages lead to illness and discontent.
- **Drinking Water:** Crucial; running out forces risky decisions like landing on dangerous islands.
- **Grog:** A morale booster; its absence can cause unrest among the crew.
- **Ammunition:** Limited; players must balance combat with conservation.

Special Considerations:
- **Nyxie, the Ship's Cat:** Vital for rodent control and crew morale. Her health directly impacts ship conditions. Neglecting Nyxie leads to infestations and lowered morale.
- **Crew Morale:** Influenced by rations, leadership decisions, and Nyxieâ€™s well-being. Low morale can cause conflicts, desertion, or mutiny.

Resource scarcity creates natural adventure hooks, forcing players into tough choices.
