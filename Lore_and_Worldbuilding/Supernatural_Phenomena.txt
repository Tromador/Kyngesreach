Supernatural Phenomena

The Kyngesreach Archipelago is rife with magical and supernatural occurrences that defy natural laws:

- **Mystical Storms:** Endless tempests trap ships, sometimes tied to ancient curses or vengeful spirits.
- **Shifting Islands:** Certain islands vanish or relocate, making navigation perilous.
- **Time Anomalies:** Regions where time flows differently, causing disorientation or dangerous aging effects.
- **Cursed Relics:** Ancient artifacts hold immense power but come with dire consequences.
- **Climate Anomalies:** While the archipelago is generally temperate-tropical, some islands exhibit unnatural climates explained by magical disruptions or ancient technologies.

Such phenomena often serve as key elements in adventures, treasure hunts, or moral quandaries.
