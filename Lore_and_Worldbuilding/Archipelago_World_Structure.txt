World Structure: The Kyngesreach Archipelago

The Kyngesreach Archipelago is a vast, dangerous, and largely uncharted region extending into mysterious waters. There is no central civilization within the archipelago; islands vary in environment, danger, and culture. Ports and settlements with trade and repair facilities are rare and highly valuable. As adventurers travel farther from the mainland, islands become increasingly perilous and enigmatic, often defying natural laws.

The campaign begins at a well-known mainland port, serving as the last bastion of civilization before the party ventures into the unknown. Lore about the archipelago is scarce and considered valuable treasure, often driving exploration. Maps are unreliable, making navigation a crucial part of the journey. Some islands feature strange climates (e.g., arctic conditions in a tropical zone) explained by magical or supernatural phenomena, forming part of unique adventures.
