Factions of the Archipelago

Various factions vie for influence within the Kyngesreach Archipelago:

- **Merchant Consortium:** Present only at the starting mainland port, this powerful economic force drives exploration for new trade routes. They may fund expeditions or offer lucrative contracts.
- **Iron Tide:** A formidable pirate fleet introduced later in the campaign. Operating in a specific region of the archipelago, they become a recurring threat to trade and exploration.
- **Stormcallers' Cult:** Mystics who wield weather magic and claim to speak for the sea. Their intentions are often unclear—ranging from protective to destructive.
- **Port Authority Alliances:** Loose coalitions of merchants, privateers, and mercenaries maintain order on rare port islands.
- **Isolationist Tribes:** Independent island communities often hostile to outsiders, defending their autonomy fiercely.
- **Treasure Seekers & Scholars:** Adventurers and academics race to uncover the archipelago’s lost secrets, sometimes helping, sometimes hindering the party.

Factions may become allies, enemies, or both over the course of the campaign.
