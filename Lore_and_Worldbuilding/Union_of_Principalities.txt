# Union of Principalities

The Union of Principalities is a loose federation of independent, absolute monarchies that maintain close ties through trade, diplomacy, and a joint military structure.

## Structure and Governance
- Each principality is ruled by a sovereign prince, with absolute authority within their territory.
- The Union operates a **Joint Council**, where each prince sends representatives to discuss shared interests such as trade, diplomacy, and defense.
- Decisions in the Joint Council require consensus or a majority vote, but enforcement is left to individual principalities.

## Military and Navy
- The **Union of Principalities Navy (UPN)** is jointly funded and operated by all member states.
- Ships in the UPN retain their principalityâ€™s identity but serve under a shared command structure.
- Officers may hail from different principalities, creating political tension and competition within the ranks.
- The UPN is responsible for anti-piracy operations, trade protection, and exploratory missions.

## Trade and Economy
- While each principality controls its own economy, common trade agreements exist to prevent disputes.
- Merchants are highly influential and sometimes rival nobility in power, often leveraging the Union for personal gain.

## Internal Politics
- Some principalities support stronger Union authority, while others wish to maintain full autonomy.
- Political maneuvering, alliances, and rivalries between principalities can create conflicts even within the Joint Council.
