# Structured Creative Session Handbook (with Phase Control and Prompts)

## Purpose
Allow natural brainstorming and free creativity, while ensuring smooth transition into disciplined scene recovery and final adventure consolidation.

---

# Phases Overview

## Phase 1: Creative Phase

- Free brainstorming encouraged.
- Non-linear exploration of scenes, characters, world-building.
- Evolution of earlier ideas allowed (retcon flexibility).
- Snapshots recorded after major beats to preserve structure.
- No scene is permanently locked.
- No automatic summarisation or packaging allowed.

**Framing Prompt at Start of Session:**

> "Session Framing Instructions:  
> This project operates in two phases:  
> 1. Creative Phase (free brainstorming, flexible evolution).  
> 2. Packaging Phase (strict scene-by-scene consolidation).  
> Preserve this two-phase model.  
> Acknowledge and await further instruction."

---

## Phase 2: Packaging Phase

- Systematic scene-by-scene consolidation begins.
- Markdown formatting required.
- No new creative expansions unless explicitly requested.
- Revisions happen only if explicitly authorized.
- Final adventure document grows sequentially.
- No summarisation or condensation allowed.
- Full descriptive richness, dialogue, and mechanical detail must be preserved.

**Handover Prompt When Switching Phases:**

> "Creative Phase complete.  
> Begin Packaging Phase now.

> Rules for Packaging Phase:
> - Consolidate scenes one-by-one into clean Markdown.
> - Do not summarise.
> - Do not condense.
> - Preserve full detail, dialogue, descriptive richness, and GM notes.
> - Output each scene in full, based on Creative Phase material.
> - No trimming or smoothing unless explicitly requested.

> Await my approval after each scene before proceeding."

# Techniques for Both Phases

## Snapshots (Creative Phase)
- Record the current intent of a scene or fragment.
- Can evolve later if needed.

**Prompt:**
> "Snapshot:  
> Scene X: [current scene concept in brief]."

---

## Revision Logs (Creative Phase)
- Track changes when later ideas affect earlier material.

**Prompt:**
> "Revision Log:  
> Update Scene X to reflect [new idea] for narrative consistency."

---

## Savepoints (Creative Phase)
- Dump all created scenes at major milestones (every 3â€“5 big beats).

**Prompt:**
> "Snapshot Dump:  
> Output all current developed material in raw Markdown. Label scenes clearly."

---

## Scene-by-Scene Output (Packaging Phase)
- Each scene rendered individually in clean, publishable Markdown.

**Prompt:**
> "Render Scene X:  
> - Title as H2 (## Title)  
> - Subheadings (###) for beats  
> - Dialogue in normal paragraphs  
> - GM notes in blockquotes (>)  
> - Lists where appropriate."

# Mid-Session Reinforcement Prompts

**During Creative Phase:**
> "Reminder: We are still in Creative Phase. Brainstorm freely. No structuring yet."

**During Packaging Phase:**
> "Reminder: Full scenes only. No summarisation or condensation. Strict recovery."

# Best Practices

- Preserve flexibility early; enforce discipline later.
- Use minimal but clear snapshots to avoid heavy overhead.
- Delay polishing until full draft completion.
- Protect creative spontaneity without losing final structure integrity.
