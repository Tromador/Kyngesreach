Voyage Preparation and Departure,
Following Captain Godfrey’s departure briefing—delivered to the full crew after lunch the day before sailing—the expeditionaries took his warnings seriously. With time running short, they used the remainder of the day to outfit themselves.

Morgan, still carrying the injuries from the Scythe Point temple, equipped himself with proper armour and a set of armouring tools to complement the ship's forge.,
Penelope, Calloway, and Biele also acquired various types of protection appropriate to their roles.,
Crafting supplies and personal gear were stocked. Biele acquired fletching tools; Morgan ensured the forge could manage battlefield repairs; Penelope, always practical, purchased a barrel of pickles as insurance against Cookie’s culinary horrors.,

Shortly after the ship cleared the harbour, Penelope—still travelling under the alias “Rook”—relocated her belongings to the female officers’ quarters, prompting an immediate confrontation with Lieutenant Hargrave. When challenged, Penelope revealed her true identity. Hargrave was incensed by the deception and escalated the matter to Captain Godfrey.

The expeditionaries were summoned. Godfrey, clearly furious, threatened to return Penelope to Verenza unless he had reason to believe she was worth the risk. In a tense exchange, Penelope gave her true name and confirmed the rest of her application was genuine. Godfrey relented, though coolly, and permitted her to remain aboard with updated quarters. Trust, however, would take time.
The next day, the expeditionaries began circulating the ship. Calloway started a logbook and scouted sketching positions. Morgan kept to the forge. Biele kept her eyes open. Penelope, meanwhile, began showing signs of illness, which she loudly attributed to the ship’s galley rather than the motion of the sea.

Incident 1: The Breaking Line,
On Day 2, the expeditionaries participated in a rigging drill overseen by Iron Meg (Boatswain Kincaid) and Lieutenant Drake.

The players were split across the work:
Biele, despite no experience, eagerly joined the line-handling crew, determined to learn by doing.,
Calloway attempted to climb the rigging, but failed so thoroughly he barely cleared the deck. Recovering with a grin, he joined Biele in pulling the ropes.,
Morgan stepped back, observing with a trained eye, positioning himself to offer guidance or assistance as needed.,

The group was instructed to haul together on cue, following the deckhand chant:
“Two… six… HEAVE!”

The cadence struck some of the players as peculiar—no explanation was offered, and none appeared forthcoming—but it was repeated across the deck with energy and discipline.

Midway through the drill, Morgan spotted a problem. One of the lines under strain was fraying under the load. He shouted a warning just as the rope snapped, sending a junior crewman swinging loose.

The sailor ended up dangling upside down by one ankle, caught in a secondary line, spinning gently over the deck. Morgan’s quick reaction—and the cohesion of the drill team—prevented anything worse.
Iron Meg surveyed the scene.

“That’s why we practice now.”

Inspection of the broken rope confirmed poor quality material. Kincaid ordered a full audit of all rigging, and Morgan’s stock among the crew quietly rose.

Incident 2: The Whispering Hold,
On the second night at sea, the players witnessed a growing knot of sailors gathering near the after hold. At the centre was Nyxie, the ship’s cat—seated at the hatchway, growling steadily into the shadows below, tail twitching.

Whispers of ghosts, curses, and salt sigils were circulating. The air was tense.

Boatswain Meg arrived, regarded the scene, and turned to the players:

“Right. That’s enough ghost watching.”
“You lot—come with me. Bring a lantern. We’re going to settle whatever superstitious nonsense this is before it turns into a proper panic.”
“If there’s a curse on this hold, I’ll have a word with it myself.”

Below, they found Torrin, drunk and sprawled beside a leaking grog cask. As the party approached, he looked up and sneered:

“Come to collect your hero points, have you? Go on, drag me up. Maybe I’ll clap when you’re done.”

Calloway moved to get him up, and Torrin punched Meg. Not hard—but it landed.
Before she could retaliate, Calloway and Morgan tackled him cleanly and restrained him. He was escorted to Lieutenant Hargrave, who issued sentence on the spot:

“He’s stolen from the ship’s stores, stoked fear among the men, and struck a superior.”
“Default will be at eight bells in the afternoon watch.”
“Take him below.”

Incident 3: The Flogging at Eight Bells,
On Day 3, the full ship's company was ordered to muster on deck for the punishment of Torrin, whose crimes—drunkenness, theft, and striking a superior—had resulted in the standard sentence: twelve lashes.

Attendance was mandatory. Biele, uncomfortable with the entire premise, protested quietly but was informed by a marine that “attendance is by standing order.” Even Penelope, still pale and unsteady from illness, was helped up from her bunk and escorted to her proper place.

The crew assembled on the main deck, while the officers and expeditionaries—including the players—took their places on the quarterdeck, alongside a trio of young midshipmen to whom they had yet to be introduced.

The ceremony was conducted with strict naval formality:

Drake reported the deck ready.,
Godfrey gave the nod.,
Hargrave read the charges aloud.,

Before sentence was carried out, she turned to Torrin and asked:

“Have you anything to say before sentence is carried out?”
Torrin lifted his chin.

“You drag me to sea against my will, feed me salt meat and slop, and whip me for taking the only thing that felt like mine.”
“No ma’am. I’ve nothing to say you’d want to hear.”

Hargrave gave no reply.

Iron Meg delivered all twelve lashes, each with deliberate force.,
Catesby applied vinegar dressing once the punishment was complete.,

Torrin remained conscious, though bloodied. He was carried below by two marines. The crew remained silent throughout.

Player Reactions,
Biele threw up over the rail immediately after the dismissal.,
Calloway remained upright, but pale and shaken—clearly disturbed by the structured brutality.,
Morgan, drawing on his military background, showed no visible reaction beyond a subtle tightening of his jaw.,
Penelope, though weakened, remained on her feet for the duration, avoiding eye contact and returning below immediately after.,

The moment stood as a stark reminder of what holds a ship together when thousands of miles from land: order, fear, and the unbending weight of regulation.

Incident 4: Going Off Half-Cock,
On the morning of Day 4, Captain Pembroke oversaw a live-fire musket drill with the marine detachment. After addressing the company with a typically overwrought speech, he invited the expeditionaries to participate.

Morgan, clearly confident with firearms, stepped up immediately. Though the musket was unfamiliar, his prior training with pistols showed. He delivered a clean, deliberate shot that struck near the centre of the target, drawing a few nods from nearby marines.

Calloway, despite having no formal experience with firearms, surprised everyone with a well-aimed shot that struck true. Whether luck or natural coordination, it landed solid.

Biele, initially hesitant, was drawn in when Pembroke turned to her and offered, with unusual courtesy:

Pembroke:
“Won’t you give it a try, m’lady?”

The unexpected gentleness of the invitation disarmed her, and she accepted. Though plainly uncomfortable and clearly unfamiliar with firearms, she raised the musket and managed to strike the outer edge of the target—earning a soft “Hm.” from Pembroke and a few murmurs of approval.
Following the player volley, Pembroke resumed control and ordered:

Pembroke:
“Marines! Stand to!”

The formation stepped forward for a second volley.

Then, without warning, one musket discharged early. A shot rang out—one marine cried out as a grazing wound opened along his thigh, and the shooter yelped, clutching his face from a powder flash burn.

---

Immediate Response,
Pembroke began shouting commands—but lost control of the moment almost instantly.

“Recover—recover arms! Cease—recover positions!”

Biele did not step in, overwhelmed by the sudden chaos.

Morgan began to move forward to take charge—but Mallory was already there, barking crisp, effective orders.

Mallory (to Morgan, snapping):
“You—check that piece. Tell me if it’s the steel or the idiot.”

She shoved the misfiring weapon into Morgan’s hands.

Morgan, treating it with professional care, confirmed the lock assembly was worn and the half-cock notch dangerously loose—a legitimate mechanical fault.
Meanwhile, Calloway stepped forward and calmly assessed both injured men. His first aid confirmed that both wounds were superficial, and neither man was in danger—though the shooter was shaken and mortified.

---

Conclusion,
With order restored, Pembroke awkwardly addressed the assembly:

Pembroke (self-important, painfully tone-deaf):
“I’d like to think we’ve all grown from this. Even a touch of adversity can strengthen the line.”
“To your duties. Dismissed.”

The words landed like dead weight.

As the company began to break formation, Mallory stalked past the players, boots striking hard on the planks, muttering as she passed:

“Might not be a waste of powder after all.”

Morgan, watching her go, turned to the others and observed dryly:

“That’s high praise coming from her. Make no mistake—she’s the one running the marines.”

No one argued.

Incident 5: The Greenhand’s Catch,
Late on Day 4, as the crew moved about their evening routines and the players were heading below for the evening meal, a minor but sudden hazard occurred on deck.

A rigging block had worked loose from an improperly belayed line and begun to swing in a wide, lazy arc—low and fast enough to break bone or worse if it hit someone at the wrong angle. The motion was quiet enough that most missed it.

Hollis, a greenhand, was the first to spot the danger. He shouted a warning and dove for the line, attempting to secure it—but lacked the strength alone to haul it in.

A couple of the players, closest to the scene, jumped in and helped bring the rigging under control before it could hurt anyone. The action was fast, coordinated, and neatly handled.

Hargrave arrived moments later, glanced at the rig, then at the crewman holding the line.

Hargrave:
“What’s your name, crewman?”
Hollis: “Hollis, ma’am.”
Hargrave: “Good eyes, Hollis. Carry on.”
The acknowledgement drew a few nods from the nearby crew—and goodwill from the players, who were clearly pleased to see someone on the lower deck taking initiative and getting credit for it.

Penelope, now recovered from her sickness, was back on deck. When told that dinner was being served, she remarked:

Penelope (dryly):
“Cooking’s improving. I could at least identify the ingredients.”

As the party headed toward the galley, a sailor near the hatch muttered under his breath:

“I’d take the swinging block over Cookie’s stew.”
