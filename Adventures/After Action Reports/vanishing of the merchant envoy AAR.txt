🪓 Mission Brief
Captain Elias Godfrey summoned the candidates aboard the UPS Sojourner for a private briefing.
Enzo Falciere, the merchant envoy responsible for finalizing supplies and contracts, had disappeared just days before departure. His absence threatened the expedition’s logistics and morale. The party was instructed to investigate discreetly, with the understanding that this would serve as a proving ground for their leadership.

---

🏠 The Falciere Residence
Enzo’s wife, Vittoria, was distraught but forthcoming:
Enzo had begun disappearing at night, returning soaked and evasive.,
He received visits from hooded men, and had become increasingly fixated on the sea.,
,
Their young son, Marco, remarked that “Papa talks to the ocean” and mentioned a man with no face.,
Vittoria, unsure of what else to do, directed the group to Enzo’s office and warehouse.,

---

🗃 The Office
The party found discrepancies in the records, including missing payments and shipment irregularities.,
A scrap of paper bearing a rough coastline sketch was recovered from among Falciere’s documents.,

---

📦 The Warehouse
Overseer Matteo Caravelli was clearly terrified and initially evasive.
Penelope successfully intimidated him into cooperation.,
Calloway noticed a spiral-shaped tattoo on Matteo’s wrist.,
,
Inside, the warehouse was in chaotic disarray:
Smashed crates, signs of a struggle, and bloodstains on the floorboards.,
A salt-drawn sigil marked the floor.,
,
The party pried up a section of flooring and discovered a well-like vertical shaft, filled with still seawater.
It appeared to connect to the sea, but the depth or purpose remained unclear.,
,

---

⚓ Departure
The map scrap was identified by Godfrey and Biele as part of the cliffs near Scythe Point.,
The party hired Skipper Branick Vell, negotiating his price from 10 crowns to 15 crowns and a good bottle of booze.,
After a night’s rest (and a dreadful breakfast courtesy of Cookie), Penelope treated the group to a proper meal.,
Biele kept to herself, joining the others in time for the tide-runner’s departure.,
🌊 The Temple at Scythe Point
The cave at low tide revealed a path into a flooded, long-abandoned temple.,
The party discovered:
Ancient offering basins,
Faded murals of ritual sacrifice,
A ritual knife, claimed by Penelope,
A rockfall trap, avoided by quick thinking and skill,
,
In a shrine chamber, Calloway noticed dry, clean stone on the altar.
Penelope found a knife slot in the altar.,
When inserted, the water drained, revealing a hidden stairway.,
,

🧟 The Confrontation with Enzo Falciere
At the base of the stair, they found Enzo—undead, but aware, and filled with grief.
“Now I am what waits.”,
“You came… just like they wanted.”,
,
Combat broke out:
Biele revealed her spellcasting, using air magic to little effect.,
Penelope’s pistol shot struck true, despite his unnatural resilience.,
Morgan and his hound fought in close combat; the dog avoided a grapple, but Morgan suffered a serious wound.,
Calloway, delayed by unloaded pistols, joined late.,
,
Enzo flooded the room, summoning seaweed and grasping spectral hands to block retreat.,
The fight ended only when Enzo was struck down, and the unnatural pressure faded.,

---

🔚 Aftermath
The group found a matching tattoo on Enzo’s body.,
They left him where he fell and returned his family sword to Godfrey, then to Vittoria.
She pledged to fund the expedition in full and paid them 1,000 crowns in thanks.,
,

---

⚰️ A Final Visit
The group returned to see Matteo one last time.
He was calm, spoke cryptically—and then used a hidden blade to cut his own throat.,
Briny seawater, not blood, spilled from the wound.,
,

---

✅ Conclusion
The envoy is dead. The mission is back on track. The ship will sail.
But something deeper moved beneath it all—and still might.

“The sea remembers.”
