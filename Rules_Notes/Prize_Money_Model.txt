Kyngesreach Campaign - Prize Money Model for Crew Compensation

Overview:
In the Kyngesreach campaign, the crew aboard the adventurer's ship is compensated using a prize money model rather than a share-based system. This approach helps maintain crew loyalty while ensuring the players retain a meaningful portion of any treasure or profits found during the expedition.

Prize Money Split:
- **60% of all profits:** Allocated to the ship's fund, covering:
  - Crew and officer prize money payouts.
  - Ship repairs and maintenance.
  - Essential supplies (food, water, ammunition, grog).
  - Medical expenses and compensation for injuries.

- **40% of all profits:** Allocated to the players (PCs):
  - Divided equally among the player characters.
  - Players may select and retain certain valuable items (rare weapons, masterwork equipment, magical items) in addition to their monetary share.

Distribution of the Ship’s 60% Share:
The 60% ship fund is further divided into three primary allocations:

1. **Prize Money Pool (50% of the ship’s 60% share):**
   - Direct payout to officers and enlisted crew.
   - Example Distribution:
     - Captain (NPC): ~10% of the prize pool.
     - Officers: ~25% collectively, divided by rank.
     - Average Crew: ~65% shared equally among crew ratings.

2. **Ship Maintenance and Repairs (30% of the ship’s 60% share):**
   - Covers repairs, hull integrity, sail replacements, and cannon upkeep.
   - Prevents breakdowns and costly delays.

3. **Supply and Operating Reserve (20% of the ship’s 60% share):**
   - Funds essential provisions, port fees, and emergency reserves.
   - Maintains morale by preventing shortages of food, grog, and ammunition.

Emergency Expense Protocol:
- **Primary Source:** Players' 40% share is used first for emergencies (e.g., sudden repairs, urgent resupply).
- **Crew Protection Clause:** The crew’s prize money is only affected if both the ship’s fund and players' shares are depleted.
- **Roleplaying Impact:** Choosing to spend player funds to safeguard morale presents meaningful dilemmas.

Player Incentives:
- Players retain significant profits and first pick of rare equipment.
- Personal wealth must be balanced against crew morale and ship functionality.

Example Distribution Scenario:
- **Treasure Haul Value:** 10,000 gold coins
  - Ship Fund (60%): 6,000 gold
    - Prize Money Pool (50%): 3,000 gold
    - Ship Maintenance (30%): 1,800 gold
    - Supplies Reserve (20%): 1,200 gold
  - Player Pool (40%): 4,000 gold (1,000 each for a four-player party)
  - Players retain chosen equipment outside this split.

**Emergency Scenario:**  
A 2,500 gold repair cost is drawn from the players' pool, leaving them with 1,500 gold. Crew prize money remains intact, preserving morale.

Rationale & Benefits:
- **Fairness:** Guarantees crew compensation.
- **Operational Stability:** Ensures ongoing ship functionality.
- **Player Responsibility:** Wealth entails accountability.
- **Emergency Preparedness:** Minimizes mutiny risks and enhances narrative tension.

Potential Complications & Plot Hooks:
- Crew discontent from delayed payments.
- Strained resources forcing difficult choices.
- Rival factions exploiting financial strain.
- Moral dilemmas over personal wealth versus crew loyalty.

Final Notes:
This model fosters a balance between rewarding players and sustaining ship operations. It encourages thoughtful resource management and creates opportunities for engaging roleplay and decision-making.
