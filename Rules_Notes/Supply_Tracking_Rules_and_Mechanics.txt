Supply Tracking Rules & Mechanics

In the Kyngesreach campaign, tracking supplies is crucial for survival, morale, and decision-making. Players must monitor key resources to avoid dire consequences like starvation, dehydration, or mutiny.

Tracked Resources:
- **Food:** Essential for daily rations. Lack of food leads to fatigue, lowered morale, and potential health penalties.
- **Drinking Water:** More critical than food. Dehydration effects start after 1 day without water, leading to severe penalties.
- **Grog:** Used to maintain crew morale. Without it, morale decreases, potentially leading to disobedience.
- **Ammunition:** Vital for defense and combat encounters. Running out limits offensive capabilities.

Resource Consumption:
- Each crew member consumes:
  - **Food:** 2 meals per day
  - **Water:** 3 liters per day
  - **Grog:** 1 liter per day (optional but morale-boosting)
- Ammunition is consumed as used in combat, based on the weapons deployed.

Morale Impact:
- **Full Rations:** Crew morale remains stable.
- **Half Rations:** -1 to morale daily after two consecutive days.
- **No Rations:** -2 to morale daily; potential for rebellion after 3 days.
- **Nyxieâ€™s Influence:** If Nyxie is unhappy or sick, an additional -1 morale penalty applies.

Vermin Control:
- Nyxie prevents rodent infestations when healthy and happy.
- If Nyxie is neglected, rats begin consuming food supplies at a rate of 1d6 meals per day.

Replenishment:
- Supplies can be replenished at rare ports or through island exploration.
- Fresh water may be found on certain islands, but risks and dangers vary.

Events Triggered by Shortages:
- Random encounters may occur when supplies run low (mutiny threats, sickness outbreaks, forced landings on dangerous islands).

Tracking Tools:
- Use the provided **Supply Tracking Sheet** and **Crew Morale Sheet** to monitor resources.
- Update supplies daily and after significant events like battles or resupply stops.

These rules ensure resource management remains a key strategic element of the campaign.
