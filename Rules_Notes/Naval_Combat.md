## 🧮 Firing Resolution

### 1. Gunner (Cannon) Roll
- Skill: 12 (crew average)
- Apply modifiers: Wind Gauge, range, morale, damage
- Margin of Success¹ determines the hit rate.

### 2. Hit Percentage
| MoS¹ | Hit Rate |
|-----|----------|
| 0–1 | 10% |
| 2–3 | 25% |
| 4–5 | 50% |
| 6–7 | 75% |
| 8+  | 100% |

- Multiply by operational guns (12 per battery for Sojourner).
- Round down.

### 3. Hit Location (1d per hit)
| Roll | Location      | Effect |
|------|---------------|--------|
| 1–2  | Hull          | Damage vs DR |
| 3    | Rigging/Sails | See Sail Damage |
| 4    | Deck Crew     | -10% Readiness |
| 5    | Cannons       | 1d destroyed, reload delay |
| 6    | Critical      | See Critical Table |

| 9-pounder     | 6d×2 |
| 18-pounder    | 6d×3 |
| 32-pounder    | 6d×4 |

- Only **penetrating hits** (damage > DR) can trigger criticals.

|------|--------|
| 1    | Fire on deck |
| 2    | Steering damaged |
| 3    | Magazine disruption |

## 🏹 Aiming & Ammunition

### Target Areas & Required Ammo
| Target          | Ammo      | Penalty | Effect |
|-----------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Rudder          | Round     | -3 | Steering disabled |
| Rigging/Sails   | Chain     | -3 | See Sail Damage |
| Masts/Spars     | Bar       | -6 | Mast/spar collapse |
| Deck Crew       | Grape     | -3 | -10% Readiness per hit; officer injury chance |

## 🚢 Sojourner's Context
- Broadside: 12 × 9-pounders per side
- Total Guns: 24
- Class: Mid-range fifth-rate frigate (~late 18th century)
- Quick, maneuverable, but not suited for line battles against heavier ships

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Magical Wind Effects (Conditional)
- Magical Wind contests (e.g., Biele vs. Stormcaller) resolved via:
  - Quick Contest of spell skills, or
  - GM adjudication if magic strength is mismatched
- Applied only if both sides field magical wind-control effects.

---

¹ **Margin of Success (MoS)**: The difference between your effective skill and your actual die roll result. For example, if your modified skill is 12 and you roll a 9, your MoS is 3. The greater your MoS, the better your performance. Use the following hit rate table based on MoS:

| MoS | Hit Rate |
|-----|----------|
| 0–1 | 10% |
| 2–3 | 25% |
| 4–5 | 50% |
| 6–7 | 75% |
| 8+  | 100% |
