## üå¨Ô∏è Rigging & Sails Damage ‚Äì HP System
| Ship Class        | Sail HP |
|-------------------|---------|
| Sloop/Brig        | 100 |

| 9-pounder      | 10 HP |
| 18-pounder     | 20 HP |
| 32-pounder     | 40 HP |

| Sail HP Loss (% of Total) | Effect |

## üö¢ Internal Damage System ‚Äì Hull Integrity Points (HIP)

### Concept
- Each penetrating hull hit reduces **HIP** based on **penetration strength (PS)**:  
\[
PS = \text{Damage Rolled} - \text{Ship DR}
\]
- HIP loss per hit:  
\[
\text{HIP Loss} = \min(\text{PS}, 50)
\]

| Penetration Strength (PS) | HIP Loss |
|----------------------------|----------|
| 1‚Äì10                       | -10 |
| 11‚Äì20                      | -20 |
| 21‚Äì30                      | -30 |
| 31‚Äì50                      | -40 |
| >50                        | -50 |

### Revised HIP Values (scaled √ó2.5)
| Ship Class        | HIP |
|-------------------|-----|
| Sloop/Brig        | 250 |
| Frigate (Sojourner)| 500 |
| Ship-of-the-Line  | 1000‚Äì1250 |

### Sinking Thresholds
| HIP Remaining | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| 75‚Äì100%      | Minor damage; cosmetic leaks |
| 50‚Äì75%       | Noticeable stress; limited system failures |
| 25‚Äì50%       | Severe flooding; impaired movement and reduced firing capability |
| 10‚Äì25%       | Critical flooding; uncontrollable flooding begins |
| 0‚Äì10%        | Rapid sinking, inevitable loss |
| 0            | Ship founders and sinks |

### Footnote
¬π **Hull Integrity Points (HIP):** A numerical measure of a ship‚Äôs overall structural integrity, representing the cumulative effect of penetrating hits to the hull. When HIP is reduced to zero, the ship founders and sinks.

## üö¢ Sojourner's Context
- Broadside: 12 √ó 9-pounders per side
- Total Guns: 24
- Class: Mid-range fifth-rate frigate (~late 18th century)
- Quick, maneuverable, but not suited for line battles against heavier ships

---

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Magical Wind Effects (Conditional)
- If one side uses a magical wind spell (e.g., Biele‚Äôs trailing wind), it gains **+2 Wind Gauge bonus**.  
- If both sides use magic, compare effects: stronger effect wins; if equally matched, resolve with a Quick Contest of spellcasting or GM adjudication.
