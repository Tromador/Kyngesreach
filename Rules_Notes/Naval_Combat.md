# ‚öì Kyngesreach Naval Combat Rules  

A scalable, GURPS-compatible system for age-of-sail ship combat in
Kyngesreach, focusing on realism, tactical engagement, and historical
plausibility. 

In naval combat, the ship functions as a cohesive unit rather than a
collection of individual actions. Therefore, each vessel operates under
a unified **crew skill rating**, representing the collective competence
and training of the ship‚Äôs crew. This approach maintains simplicity and
realism by avoiding excessive tracking of individual abilities.

However, individual skill can still influence a ship‚Äôs performance.
Players and key NPCs, such as officers or veteran gunners, may leverage
their personal skills to confer advantages in critical moments. For
example, a **Leadership (Naval)** or **Tactics (Naval)** roll with a
high margin of success may accelerate gun reloading, or a decisive
action by a skilled character might sway a morale check. These
individual contributions are outlined in the relevant sections of the
rules.

This system strikes a balance between realism and playability, ensuring
that the ship remains the primary unit of action while still allowing
for heroic moments and tactical decisions by characters.  
  
This system is designed for straightforward, engaging play without the
need for detailed hex paper, miniatures, or exhaustive measurement
tools. The focus is on cinematic, narrative-driven naval combat rather
than complex tactical wargaming. Players can immerse themselves in the
action without spending the entire session on granular movement and
firing calculations. This necessarily causes some realism to be lost at
the expense of balance, compactness and speed. Some possibilities have
been fudged or even ignored completely.

## üå¨Ô∏è Initiative & Position ‚Äì Wind Gauge

### üìÖ Round 1: Reading the Weather

Each side nominates a PC/NPC to roll ****Weather Sense****

|                          |             |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| **Weather Sense Result** | **ModiÔ¨Åer** |
| Success                  | \+1         |
| Critical Success         | \+2         |
| Failure                  | 0           |
| Critical Failure         | \-1         |

### üîÅ Round 2+: Contesting the Wind

Both sides roll ****Contested Seamanship**** each round.

</tbody>
</table>

#### Tie Result:

  - Both sides fire **simultaneously** at **-1** accuracy.
  - Neither may switch battery.
  - Wind Gauge resets.

### üéñÔ∏è Wind Gauge Benefits

  - Fires first
  - \+1 to Gunner (Cannon)
  - Chooses battery (port/starboard)
  - May attempt to change range

## üßÆ Firing Resolution

### 1\. Gunner (Cannon) Roll

  - Skill: Average crew 12, but can vary.
  - Apply modifiers: Wind Gauge, range, morale, damage
  - Margin of Success (MoS)¬π determines the hit rate.

### 2\. Hit Percentage

|         |              |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **MoS** | **Hit Rate** |
| 0‚Äì1     | 10%          |
| 2‚Äì3     | 25%          |
| 4‚Äì5     | 50%          |
| 6‚Äì7     | 75%          |
| 8+      | 100%         |

  - Multiply by operational guns.
  - Round down.

### 3\. Base Damage

  - The vast difference in firepower between ship classes makes it clear
    that engaging a larger opponent can be suicidal.
    
      - Sometimes the best tactic is to strike colors or attempt a
        retreat rather than face overwhelming firepower.

|                          |                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| **Gun Calibre (in lbs)** | **Damage (Crushing)** |
| 4                        | 4d+1                  |
| 6                        | 5d-1                  |
| 9 (Sojourner)            | 6d                    |
| 12                       | 7d+1                  |
| 18                       | 8d+2                  |
| 24                       | 9d+2                  |
| 32                       | 10d+3                 |

### 4\. Penetrating Hits

  - In order to inflict significant damage, shots must penetrate hull
    armour:
    
      - As in normal combat, ship‚Äôs armour is expressed as a DR
      - Exceeding DR does Internal Damage (see below)
      - Examples as shown.

|                                   |             |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Ship Class**                    | **Hull DR** |
| Sloop/Brig                        | 10-20       |
| Frigate (UPS Sojourner)           | 30          |
| 4<sup>th</sup> Rate               | 40          |
| 3<sup>rd</sup> Rate               | 55          |
| 2<sup>nd</sup> Rate               | 70          |
| 1<sup>st</sup> Rate (HMS Victory) | 80          |

### 5\. Reloading

  - Reloading a naval cannon takes time. 
    
      - You can‚Äôt keep all kinds of ammo to hand, hence switching takes
        longer.
      - If you have to unload before reloading, longer again

|                                      |          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| **Action**                           | **Time** |
| Reload with current ammo             | 3 rounds |
| Reload empty gun with new ammo type  | 4 rounds |
| Reload loaded gun with new ammo type | 5 rounds |

### **Reload Time Modifiers** 

  - PCs or NPCs may attempt a **Leadership (Naval)** or **Tactics
    (Naval)** check to coordinate faster reloads.

  - A **Margin of Success (MoS) of 4+** reduces **reload time by 1
    round** for the next volley.

  - **Pre-battle readiness** (e.g., powder and shot prepped) may also
    grant a **-1 round reload** bonus for the **first volley only**.
    
      - This bonus **does not stack** with other modifiers and must be
        declared in advance.

## üìè Range Bands

  - Range modifiers reflect both the maximum possible hits and the
    difficulty of hitting at all
  - Only the ship **with the Wind Gauge** may change range.
  - On Seamanship roll: success = can shift range band by 1

|           |                  |                 |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| **Range** | **Max Hit Rate** | **Hit ModiÔ¨Åer** |
| Extreme   | 25%              | \-4             |
| Long      | 50%              | \-2             |
| Standard  | 100%             | \+0             |
| Close     | 100%             | \+1             |

## üö¢ Internal Damage System ‚Äì Hull Integrity Points (HIP)¬≤

  - Each penetrating hull hit reduces HIP based on penetration strength
    (PS):
    
      - PS = Damage Rolled minus Ship DR
      - HIP Loss = PS to maximum of 50

|                   |                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **HIP Remaining** | **Status**              |
| 75‚Äì100%           | Minor damage            |
| 50‚Äì75%            | Noticeable stress       |
| 25‚Äì50%            | Severe Ô¨Çooding          |
| 10‚Äì25%            | Critical Ô¨Çooding        |
| 0‚Äì10%             | Rapid sinking           |
| 0                 | Ship founders and sinks |

|                     |           |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| **Ship Class**      | **HIP**   |
| Sloop/Brig          | 250       |
| Frigate (Sojourner) | 500       |
| Ship-of-the-Line    | 1000‚Äì1250 |

## üî• Critical Hits System (Penetrating Hull Hits)

  - ****Trigger:**** 1 crit roll per 4 penetrating hull hits in an
    attack.
  - ****Roll 1d6:**** On a 6, roll on the Critical Hit Table.

|          |                                                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Roll** | **EÔ¨Äect**                                                      |
| 1        | Fire below decks (severity scales with HIP damage).            |
| 2        | Steering damage: -1 Wind Gauge per half HIP damage.            |
| 3        | Splintering: Below deck crew casualties equal to HIP damage.   |
| 4        | Key crew injured ‚Äì e.g. NCO/Officer or even a Player Character |
| 5        | Severe Ô¨Çooding: double HIP damage.                             |
| 6        | Catastrophic hit: GM chooses dramatic eÔ¨Äect.                   |

## üèπ Aiming & Called Shots

  - Naval cannons are not built to achieve significant elevation, making
    it exceptionally difficult to target masts and sails from the gun
    deck. 
  - The masts and visible sections of rudder present an exceptionally
    difficult target. 
  - Appropriate ammunition must be used to create damage.
  - Any ammo may be preloaded prior to combat and will be considered the
    ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù ammunition for purposes of reloading time.

## üå≤ Dismasting 

  - Each penetrating hit inflicts damage; mast collapses after 4+
    penetrating hits.
  - Research shows mast sizes aren‚Äôt that much bigger on larger ships.

  - Mast purposes have been much simplified, to make them distinctive.
  - 2 mast ships are considered to have a fore and main.

**üå¨Ô∏è Rigging & Sails Damage Effects**

  - Simple HP system to reflect gun size vs amount of sail.
  - Once damage is taken, size of ship is irrelevant. Percentage of
    ruined sails is.

üßîCREW Readiness and Crew HP System

  - Total crew complement = Crew HP (1 crew = 1 HP).
  - Max topside crew = 20% of total crew HP √ó current Readiness %.
  - Grape shot damage cannot exceed topside crew HP at time of impact.
