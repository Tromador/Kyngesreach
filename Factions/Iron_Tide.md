# Iron Tide – Overview

## Faction Summary

The **Iron Tide** is a confederacy of pirates, privateers, and opportunistic survivors who have accepted that the Kyngesreach is a one-way voyage—and made themselves its new masters.

Built on the bones of lost ships and fractured loyalties, the Iron Tide presents a grounded, material threat to any vessel that enters the region—naval, mercantile, or exploratory.

Where the Stormcallers whisper in shadows, the Iron Tide speaks with cannon and cutlass. They do not bargain with the sea. They command it—or steal from those who try.

---

## Cultural Philosophy

- **No gods. No riddles. No mercy.**
- Survivors aren’t chosen—they’re just meaner than whatever tried to kill them.
- Every ship lost in the Reach is potential reinforcements.

---

## Leadership Structure

- **Tide Marshal** – Enforces cohesion across the fleet; a figure of last-resort authority.
- **Captain’s Council** – Leading captains vote or clash for strategy and turf.
- **Quartermasters** – Trusted logistics chiefs and enforcers.
- **Fleet Envoys** – Deliver greetings (or ultimatums) to new arrivals.

Each captain holds absolute command aboard their vessel—so long as they keep the Tide’s interests in mind.

---

## Recruitment & Expansion

New ships are always approached by an **“Iron Tide Greeting”** once spotted:
- Delivered politely.
- Backed by overwhelming force nearby.
- Acceptance is expected.

**Crew outcomes:**
- Loyalist vessels may join intact.
- Mutinous ships are “restructured.”
- Officers may be executed, ransomed, or pressed.
- Useful crew are absorbed; the rest are discarded or vanish.

---

## Fleet Characteristics

- Ships are **refitted wrecks**, captured prizes, or hybrid constructions.
- Irregular builds: salvaged hulls, patched sails, jury-rigged fittings.
- Armaments vary: outdated naval guns, alchemical fire, siege weapons.
- Preference for **fast, quiet, agile vessels** capable of ambush or pursuit.

They avoid fair fights. They seek advantage, not honour.

## Stronghold: Crucible Cay

> _“If the sea doesn’t get you, the toll gate will.”_

A drifting pirate haven built atop wreckage and volcanic reef. Its location is concealed within a maze of shoals, fog, and misdirection.

### Key Features:
- Floating drydocks
- Duelling pits and taverns
- Contraband markets
- Bribe-hungry chartkeepers
- Enforced neutrality inside the core ring (unwritten but absolute)

**All captains docked at Crucible Cay are expected to respect the code—until they sail.**

## Interaction With the Stormcallers

### Iron Tide Awareness of the Stormcallers:

- **Ordinary sailors:** Know only that “strange things happen.”
- **Junior officers:** May suspect there’s a cult or storm-related influence.
- **Senior captains:** Understand the Stormcallers exist, and some have crossed or parleyed with them.
- The Iron Tide officially ignores the cult—but privately avoids their waters when possible.

### Stormcaller Awareness of the Iron Tide:

- Near-total. They track Tide movements, ships, and politics with supernatural precision.
- View the Tide as disruptive, dangerous, and ultimately unsustainable.
- Speak of them **only among initiates**—to outsiders, the Iron Tide is never mentioned.

> _“The sea remembers. But the Iron Tide forgets who owns it.”_

---

## Campaign Use

The Iron Tide serves as:
- **Rival explorers**, scavengers, and opportunists.
- **Antagonists** in skirmishes, blockades, and naval ambushes.
- **Foils** to the party’s ideals—pragmatic survivors who’ve made the Reach a hunting ground.
- **Occasional uneasy allies** when mutual enemies arise.

They are not monsters. But they *are* predators—and the Reach is their feeding ground.

# ⚑ Lore of the Iron Tide Colours

## Origins
The flag now feared throughout the **Kyngesreach Archipelago** first appeared some thirty years ago, though its exact origins are lost amid the shifting currents and silenced tongues of the Reach. Most say it was raised by **Captain Red Grelth**, an infamous figure whose ship *Severance* bore the first crimson kraken banner. Grelth’s design was a bold statement, declaring war not on any navy but on the very *order* of the archipelago—a defiant symbol meant to cow rival pirate bands, intimidate local traders, and mark the Iron Tide as rulers of the ungoverned sea.

## Symbolism
- The **red kraken** signifies the Iron Tide’s stranglehold over lesser crews. Its hooked tentacles are said to represent the entrapment of rival ships, while the skull-like visage warns that surrender is the only alternative to ruin.
- The kraken also evokes whispered local legends of *Thalvash*, an ancient, unseen leviathan said to haunt the deeps of the Kyngesreach. Whether or not the Iron Tide actually reveres or fears this creature is unknown—but its presence on the flag is enough to unnerve sailors familiar with the tales.
- The **black background** symbolizes the shadowy, lawless nature of the Iron Tide. It’s also practical, blending into the mist and nightfall of the archipelago’s dangerous waters.
- The **red waves** at the flag’s base are a subtle nod to the bloodshed that accompanies the Iron Tide’s expansion. Some say they mark the boundaries of their claimed hunting grounds.

## Meaning to Sailors (Kyngesreach Only)
Within the archipelago, spotting the **Iron Tide flag** is akin to seeing a stormcloud brimming with lightning—it signals that death or surrender is imminent. Its appearance is whispered of among the smaller island communities and independent sailors as a dark omen. Few outside the Reach would recognize it, but within these waters, it’s a mark of fear.

Old Reach sayings, carried from island to island by half-mad drifters and fugitive merchants, murmur:

> *“When the kraken rises, the sea’s no longer yours.”*

Among Iron Tide crews, the flag is a badge of honour and loyalty, proclaiming their dominion over uncharted waters and their independence from any law but their own. Some even believe the flag carries a subtle blessing—warding off the wrath of the deep or ensuring safe passage through treacherous channels.
