# Iron Tide – Overview

## Faction Summary

The **Iron Tide** is a confederacy of pirates, privateers, and opportunistic survivors who have accepted that the Kyngesreach is a one-way voyage—and made themselves its new masters.

Built on the bones of lost ships and fractured loyalties, the Iron Tide presents a grounded, material threat to any vessel that enters the region—naval, mercantile, or exploratory.

Where the Stormcallers whisper in shadows, the Iron Tide speaks with cannon and cutlass. They do not bargain with the sea. They command it—or steal from those who try.

---

## Cultural Philosophy

- **No gods. No riddles. No mercy.**
- Survivors aren’t chosen—they’re just meaner than whatever tried to kill them.
- Every ship lost in the Reach is potential reinforcements.

---

## Leadership Structure

- **Tide Marshal** – Enforces cohesion across the fleet; a figure of last-resort authority.
- **Captain’s Council** – Leading captains vote or clash for strategy and turf.
- **Quartermasters** – Trusted logistics chiefs and enforcers.
- **Fleet Envoys** – Deliver greetings (or ultimatums) to new arrivals.

Each captain holds absolute command aboard their vessel—so long as they keep the Tide’s interests in mind.

## Recruitment & Expansion

New ships are always approached by an **“Iron Tide Greeting”** once spotted:
- Delivered politely.
- Backed by overwhelming force nearby.
- Acceptance is expected.

**Crew outcomes:**
- Loyalist vessels may join intact.
- Mutinous ships are “restructured.”
- Officers may be executed, ransomed, or pressed.
- Useful crew are absorbed; the rest are discarded or vanish.

---

## Fleet Characteristics

- Ships are **refitted wrecks**, captured prizes, or hybrid constructions.
- Irregular builds: salvaged hulls, patched sails, jury-rigged fittings.
- Armaments vary: outdated naval guns, alchemical fire, siege weapons.
- Preference for **fast, quiet, agile vessels** capable of ambush or pursuit.

They avoid fair fights. They seek advantage, not honour.

## Stronghold: Crucible Cay

> _“If the sea doesn’t get you, the toll gate will.”_

A drifting pirate haven built atop wreckage and volcanic reef. Its location is concealed within a maze of shoals, fog, and misdirection.

### Key Features:
- Floating drydocks
- Duelling pits and taverns
- Contraband markets
- Bribe-hungry chartkeepers
- Enforced neutrality inside the core ring (unwritten but absolute)

**All captains docked at Crucible Cay are expected to respect the code—until they sail.**

## Interaction With the Stormcallers

### Iron Tide Awareness of the Stormcallers:

- **Ordinary sailors:** Know only that “strange things happen.”
- **Junior officers:** May suspect there’s a cult or storm-related influence.
- **Senior captains:** Understand the Stormcallers exist, and some have crossed or parleyed with them.
- The Iron Tide officially ignores the cult—but privately avoids their waters when possible.

### Stormcaller Awareness of the Iron Tide:

- Near-total. They track Tide movements, ships, and politics with supernatural precision.
- View the Tide as disruptive, dangerous, and ultimately unsustainable.
- Speak of them **only among initiates**—to outsiders, the Iron Tide is never mentioned.

> _“The sea remembers. But the Iron Tide forgets who owns it.”_

---

## Campaign Use

The Iron Tide serves as:
- **Rival explorers**, scavengers, and opportunists.
- **Antagonists** in skirmishes, blockades, and naval ambushes.
- **Foils** to the party’s ideals—pragmatic survivors who’ve made the Reach a hunting ground.
- **Occasional uneasy allies** when mutual enemies arise.

They are not monsters. But they *are* predators—and the Reach is their feeding ground.
