# **Stormcallers' Cult**

## **Overview**
The Stormcallers are an ancient and secretive order who claim to **speak for the sea**. Their members are scattered throughout the **Kyngesreach Archipelago**, blending into isolated island communities or existing unseen beneath the notice of outsiders. **To the world, they are myth and legend**—whispered warnings among sailors, omens of tempests, and ghostly figures seen only in the mist.

The Stormcallers are **not a conventional faction** like the Merchant Consortium or the Iron Tide. They do not hold political power, nor do they seek conquest. Instead, they **guard dangerous knowledge**, interfere in select events from the shadows, and ensure that the deep secrets of the archipelago remain undiscovered.

## **Core Beliefs & Doctrine**
The Stormcallers believe that the **archipelago is sacred**—a realm shaped by powerful, unseen forces that outsiders must not disturb. Their doctrine is based on **three sacred tenets**:

1. **The Sea Remembers** – The ocean is a living entity, filled with echoes of past ages. Ancient mistakes lie beneath the waves, and to disturb them is to invite catastrophe.  
2. **Balance Above All** – The forces that shape the archipelago must remain undisturbed. Too many outsiders, too much meddling, and too many maps will tip the balance.  
3. **The Storm Calls the Unworthy** – When mortals grow arrogant and forget their place, the sea answers with tempests. Stormcallers do not see their actions as malevolent; rather, they **warn first, then cleanse if necessary**.

They see themselves as **custodians, not rulers**—they do not want power, they want **control over knowledge**.

## **Structure & Hierarchy**
The Stormcallers are **not a centralized organization**, but rather **a loose network of initiates, sages, and watchers** bound by shared knowledge and purpose.  

- **Tidecallers** – A handful of reclusive mystics who hold the deepest secrets. They communicate only through intermediaries, and few even know if they still exist.  
- **The Deep Voices** – Senior initiates who can “hear” the ocean’s will. They are responsible for interpreting omens, deciding who must be warned, and—if necessary—who must disappear.  
- **The Hidden Hands** – Agents of the cult who operate in port cities and settlements. They listen, gather intelligence, and influence events subtly. Some pose as merchants, sailors, or even priests.  
- **The Stormtouched** – Ritualists who summon storms, call the winds, and ensure that the sea itself remains their most powerful weapon. Their methods are unknown to outsiders.  
- **The Drowned** – Those who failed their initiation, lost to the sea but never truly gone. Their names are erased, but their spirits linger.

The cult **has no grand temples**—only hidden shrines in sea caves, ruins swallowed by the tide, and **deep places where only the initiated may tread**.

## **Methods & Influence**
The Stormcallers rarely act openly. Instead, they **pull the strings behind the scenes**, using fear, superstition, and the unpredictable wrath of the ocean to enforce their will.  

### **How They Maintain Secrecy:**  
- **Spreading Fear & Superstition** – They let **sailors and merchants tell their own ghost stories**, reinforcing the belief that the archipelago is cursed.  
- **Disguises & False Identities** – Some Stormcallers **live among port communities**, hiding in plain sight as healers, navigators, or reclusive hermits.  
- **Sabotage & Misdirection** – Rather than direct attacks, they **ensure that ships vanish, expeditions fail, and storms rise at the right moment**.  

### **How They Deal with Outsiders:**  
- **Warnings First** – The Stormcallers prefer **subtle warnings**—strange whispers in the wind, missing navigational charts, an unexplained shipwreck before departure.  
- **Disappearances** – If warnings fail, **key individuals vanish**. Those who seek too much knowledge about the archipelago’s deepest secrets often find themselves lost at sea.  
- **Final Judgment** – In extreme cases, a full storm is **called down upon those who refuse to listen**.



## **The Drowned**
The Drowned are those who **failed their initiation** or **were sacrificed to the sea**—but they are never truly gone. 
They **return as restless spirits or undead**, bound to the Stormcallers' will.

The Stormcallers do not speak openly of The Drowned, and outsiders **know nothing of their existence**. 
Sailors whisper of shipwrecked crews that **rise again** or of **shadows beneath the waves that move against the tide**. 

### **Nature of The Drowned**
- **Undead Servants:** The Drowned resemble **Draugr**—waterlogged, skeletal figures that reek of brine and decay.
- **Tied to the Stormcallers' Rituals:** They emerge from the depths when summoned, usually **during great storms** or at **ritual sites hidden along the coast**.
- **Impossible to Track:** The Drowned leave **no footprints**, speak in **unnatural voices**, and **vanish into the sea** after their task is done.

### **How They Are Used**
- **Silent Enforcers:** When a Stormcaller wishes to **remove an intruder without being seen**, The Drowned rise from the waves to **drag them down**.
- **Guardians of Forbidden Knowledge:** They protect ancient ruins, **lost temples**, and the deep places where **secrets must remain buried**.
- **Cursed Warnings:** If a person **escapes** after angering the Stormcallers, they may find that **their own dead shipmates return to claim them**.

### **Encounters with The Drowned**
The players may first encounter **only the legends** of The Drowned—whispers among sailors, waterlogged corpses that vanish before sunrise, or strange **drag marks leading into the sea**. 
If they push too far into **Stormcaller territory**, they may be unlucky enough to **face them directly**.
