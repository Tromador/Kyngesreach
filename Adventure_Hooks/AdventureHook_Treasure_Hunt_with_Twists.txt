Adventure Hook: Treasure Hunt with Twists

Premise:
The party has embarked on a quest to find a lost treasure. The map they’ve obtained is said to lead to a fabled island, but the map's origins are suspicious—perhaps it was forged, or it was a part of a larger set.

Dark Theme:
As they near the island, strange occurrences happen on board—the crew starts seeing ghostly apparitions, and a dangerous sea creature may be hunting them. Perhaps one of the crew members has a darker secret that could threaten everyone’s survival or the treasure’s true nature.

Potential for Moral Dilemmas:
When the treasure is found, it might come at a cost: a curse, the need for a sacrifice, or a moral choice (do they keep the treasure, risking an ancient curse, or do they abandon it for the sake of their safety?).
