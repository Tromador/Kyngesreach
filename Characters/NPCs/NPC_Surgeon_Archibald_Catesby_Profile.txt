NPC Profile: Dr. Archibald Catesby (Ship's Surgeon)

"Another day, another drunken sailor with a broken leg. But what else is new?"

---

Basic Information:
- Name: Dr. Archibald Catesby
- Age: 42
- Race: Human
- Gender: Male
- Role: Ship’s Surgeon

---

Appearance:
- Tall and lean, with sharp, angular features that give him a gaunt look.
- A well-worn coat and trousers stained with both medical fluids and tinctures, betraying his lack of concern for his appearance.
- His hands are steady, but often slightly unsteady when he’s in the middle of a drink, and his eyes show a constant air of exhaustion.
- A small, well-groomed beard and glasses that give him a more distinguished appearance, though a deep frown is often etched across his face.

---

Personality:
- Competent but Unpredictable: Catesby is a highly skilled surgeon when sober, possessing knowledge far beyond many of his peers. However, his addiction to alcohol (especially tinctures of poppy juice) can cause erratic behavior and hinder his decision-making.
- Dry Humor: He maintains a sarcastic, dry sense of humor, often joking about the crew's inevitable fate.
- Grumpy: Generally irritable, particularly when sober, and never shy about expressing his frustration with the ship’s conditions or the treatment he receives.
- Distant: Prefers the company of his herbs and tinctures over the crew. He keeps a professional distance but can occasionally reveal a gentler side when directly interacting with the wounded.

---

Motivations:
- Primary: Maintain his position aboard the ship as a means of escaping his past failures. Catesby has been sent on this voyage as a form of exile, and he's eager to "prove" his worth, but only if left to his devices.
- Secondary: To stave off the boredom and despair of being sidelined. His medical prowess is often ignored or undermined due to his reputation.
- Underlying Conflict: His addiction to alcohol and opiates constantly battles with his desire to be respected for his work, and the mounting pressure to keep sober grows each day.

---

Strengths:
- Excellent Surgeon (when sober): One of the finest surgeons in the fleet when clear-headed. He is highly skilled in treating battlefield injuries, infections, and surgical procedures.
- Herbal Knowledge: A self-taught expert in herbal remedies and tinctures, which aids his medical practice.
- Steady Hands: Even when under the influence, he is still capable of performing intricate surgeries with a steady hand.
- Sharp Mind (when sober): His knowledge of anatomy and medical procedures is unrivaled in the fleet.

---

Weaknesses:
- Addiction to Alcohol and Opium: Dr. Catesby’s reliance on tinctures of poppy juice and strong alcohol for his medical extractions often cloud his judgment and slow his reflexes. This causes him to be less reliable during certain hours of the day.
- Unpredictable Competence: His skills fluctuate depending on his state of inebriation. If you catch him sober, he’s a valuable asset; if he’s drunk or in withdrawal, his skills are significantly impaired.
- Bad Reputation: Word has spread about his unreliable behavior and questionable decisions during medical emergencies. Many of the crew are wary of him.
- Disengaged: Due to his inner conflict, he can sometimes come off as indifferent or neglectful, though he hides this with his sharp humor.
