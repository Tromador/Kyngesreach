Background:
Nyxie joined the ship’s crew as many ship’s cats do—by simply appearing one day and making herself at home. Her hunting prowess quickly earned her a permanent place aboard, and it wasn’t long before she became a beloved fixture among the crew.

Despite her small size, Nyxie holds a significant role: keeping the ship free of vermin. Her success in this regard has directly improved food stores and crew health. Beyond her practical use, she also provides comfort and companionship during long, arduous voyages.

Her presence is considered a **good luck charm**, and woe betide anyone who mistreats her—such behavior is met with swift social consequences from the crew. Some sailors even claim she brings fortune to those who earn her favor, though whether that's superstition or truth is up for debate.

---

Motivations:
- To maintain her territory aboard the ship and keep it free of unwanted pests.
- To seek warmth, food, and attention from her favored humans.
- To satisfy her curiosity about new people and places encountered during the voyage.

Relationships:
- **Captain Elias Godfrey:** Often found near the Captain’s quarters, where she enjoys a warm spot by the maps and charts.
- **First Lieutenant Isabella Hargrave:** Frequently seen curling up near Isabella when she’s reading or studying maps.
- **Dr. Archibald Catesby:** Occasionally visits the surgeon’s quarters, drawn by the interesting smells (and perhaps the warmth of his workspace).
- **The Crew:** Universally adored; Nyxie’s approval is sought by many, as her companionship is seen as a blessing.

Quotes (as interpreted by the crew):
- "Feed me, and I’ll grace you with my presence." (Usually accompanied by a demanding meow.)
- "This is my ship. You just work here."
- "If you don’t pet me, I’ll sit on your maps until you do."
