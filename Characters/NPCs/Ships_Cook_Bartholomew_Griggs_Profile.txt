Background:
Bartholomew "Cookie" Griggs has spent most of his life at sea, working on various merchant and naval vessels. He wasn’t trained in any prestigious kitchens but learned the basics of shipboard cooking early in his career. While his culinary skills never improved beyond "functional," his meals keep crews alive and working. Over the years, Cookie developed a reputation for providing food that, while far from gourmet, was at least filling and free of illness.

He joined this expedition as the ship’s cook after his previous ship was decommissioned. Cookie views this posting as just another job—one that lets him do what he loves: cook massive pots of stew and bake rock-hard biscuits. He considers himself indispensable, given that "a fed crew is a working crew."

---

Motivations:
- To ensure the crew is fed and functional, believing food solves most problems.
- Takes pride in his role and aims to keep meals coming no matter the supplies or conditions.
- Sees himself as a morale booster—even if the crew doesn’t appreciate his food.

---

Relationships:
- **Crew:** Constantly the target of mealtime complaints and jokes, but no one seriously dislikes him. Complaining about Cookie’s food is part of the ship’s routine and bonding experience.
- **Nyxie (Ship’s Cat):** Will not eat Cookie’s food, preferring to catch rats. She frequently steals ingredients from the galley before he can ruin them. Cookie’s loud, lumbering chases after Nyxie are a common source of entertainment, with crew members placing bets on how long it takes him to catch her.
- **Captain Elias Godfrey:** Appreciates that Cookie keeps the crew fed, even if he avoids mealtime conversation.
- **Isabella Hargrave:** Respects the necessity of Cookie’s work but privately grimaces through every meal.

Quotes:
- "It’s stew again. You don’t like it? There’s the ocean—help yourself."
- "If it was good enough yesterday, it’s good enough today!"
- "Fresh bread? Not till next port—chew the biscuits or starve."

Additional Information & Notes:
- **Food Quality:** Cookie’s meals are reliably terrible in taste but safe to eat. Stews are watery, bread is rock-hard, and meat is often overcooked beyond recognition. Despite this, his food keeps the crew healthy.
- **Crew Complaints:** Grumbling about meals is a daily ritual. Crew members bond over shared disdain for Cookie’s cooking while still lining up for second helpings when hungry enough.
- **Nyxie and Cookie Rivalry:** The ship’s cat regularly raids the galley, leading to chaotic chases that the crew find endlessly amusing. Bets are commonly placed on how long Cookie can chase Nyxie before giving up. Despite the annoyance, Cookie holds no grudge and occasionally leaves out scraps (which Nyxie refuses to touch).
- **Kitchen Organization:** Surprisingly, Cookie’s galley is organized amid the filth. He knows where every item is, and despite appearances, his methods prevent foodborne illness.
- **Favorite Ingredients:** Prefers working with salted meats and root vegetables that "last forever." Fresh ingredients, when available, are often ruined by his heavy-handed cooking.
