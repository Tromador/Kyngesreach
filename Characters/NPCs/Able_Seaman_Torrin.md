**Personality & Demeanour:**  
Torrin is a bitter and sharp-tongued pressed man who makes no effort to hide his resentment. He sees the voyage not as duty, but as punishment—a life taken from him by force. He’s not stupid, and he’s not entirely wrong, which makes his anger all the more potent. He has a sense of gallows humour and no time for flattery or orders barked by boys half his age.

He does his work, but only just—sullen, watchful, and with the slow burn of someone who might one day push too far. He has few friends, but those who do tolerate him often do so because he says what others won’t.

**Notes:**  
- Has old punishment scars on his back—this isn’t his first flogging.  
- Came aboard after being taken by a press gang three weeks before launch.  
- Known to mutter darkly about “floating coffins” and “men being worth less than canvas.”  
- Holds no respect for officers, but hasn’t spoken outright rebellion—until now.
