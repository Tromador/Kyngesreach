---

**Appearance:**

- Still bears the scars of flogging, worn openly

**Current Demeanour & Personality:**  
Torrin remains rough-edged and sardonic, the bitterness of press-ganging not forgotten—but something has shifted. No longer merely enduring the voyage, he now stands shoulder-to-shoulder with those he once eyed warily. Where he once muttered in corners, he now grumbles beside comrades. His respect must still be earned, but once given, it’s steady as oak.

He doesn’t flatter, doesn’t apologise, and still calls things as he sees them—but the edge of rebellion has dulled into something fiercer: loyalty forged through fire, blood, and betrayal. He’s not tame—just reliable. A sailor with a code of his own.

**Development Notes:**  
- **Turned by Trust:** After Morgan intervened during the sabotage fallout and treated him as a man rather than a threat, Torrin stepped off the path to mutiny. That respect, hard-earned and never asked for, proved to Torrin that not every officer is a bastard.  
- **Named Loyalty:** He revealed his first name, “Harlan,” to Morgan—a mark of trust from a man who once gave no names and expected no future.  
- **Combat-Proven:** Torrin stood fast during the Iron Tide assault and sabotage crisis. When the mutiny flared, he chose the ship over vengeance. That choice changed how others see him—and how he sees himself.  
- **Boatswain Meg’s View:** Still keeps an eye on him, but doesn’t check the lash when he passes anymore.

**Notable Traits & Dialogue Cues:**  
- Gallows humour: “Better drowned than bored.”  
- No-nonsense loyalty: “I’ll gut the bastard myself if he reaches for the locker. Don’t need no badge to do what’s right.”  
- Dry respect: (to Morgan) “You didn’t hang me when it would’ve been easier. That counts.”  
- Still critical: “Storm’s coming, and I ain’t talking about the weather.”

**Crew Reputation:**  
- Among the lower deck, Torrin is now a barometer of tension. If he’s calm, things are steady. If he starts pacing? Trouble’s close.  
- Among officers, he’s known as a man who will hold the line—but not politely.  
- Nyxie tolerates him. That alone says much.

**Inspirational Parallels:**  
- Closest analogue: *Styles* from the Hornblower adaptation—once a problem sailor, now the kind you want on your side when the rigging’s ablaze and someone’s knifed the watch officer.
