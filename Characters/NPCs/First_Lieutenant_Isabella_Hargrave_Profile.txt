Background:
Born into a family of landed gentry, Isabella Hargrave was expected to inherit her family's estate, title, and wealth. Her parents envisioned a future of social engagements and estate management, but Isabella had other plans. Fascinated by stories of exploration and driven by an insatiable curiosity, she rejected her predetermined path in favor of a naval career.

Her decision to join the navy caused significant tension with her family, who saw it as a reckless abandonment of duty and privilege. Letters urging her to return home still arrive occasionally, but this expedition represents her escape from those expectations. Sailing into the unknown is not just a professional venture—it’s her chance at freedom and self-discovery.

Isabella’s years in the navy have been marked by a steady rise through the ranks, fueled by her dedication, intelligence, and ability to lead with both compassion and authority. She views the Kyngesreach expedition as the culmination of her ambitions: an opportunity to explore uncharted waters, document new discoveries, and live a life beyond the confines of noble obligations.
